    <h2> 
I was now twelve. 
I only realized this when I looked down at my Adventurer card 
and, all of a sudden, saw the number twelve in the age column. 
When had my birthday gone by without me noticing? Being on a 
voyage like this skewed my sense of time.
Still, two years since we were teleported, huh? It had only taken 
two years to travel across both the Demon Continent and the Millis 
Continent. Or, if you looked at it the other way, two whole years had 
already passed.
At any rate, the Asura Kingdom was almost before us. After 
what had transpired on the Millis Continent, it seemed unlikely we’d 
experience much hardship from here on out. We had money and the 
means to travel. The only thing I had to worry about was not 
knowing the whereabouts of the rest of my family: Zenith, Lilia, 
Aisha, and also Sylphie. Despite Paul’s efforts, they still hadn’t been 
found. 
I believed they were all still alive, but no matter how eager I was 
to search for them, they wouldn’t be easy to find. All I could do was 
take my time and do a thorough job.
We were currently at the eastern edge of the King Dragon 
Realm in the harbor city of East Port. Just like in West Port, the city 
had a sizeable presence of fisheries and smugglers. 
We booked an inn and began our strategy meeting. As usual, the 
three of us gathered around a map, our faces pressed in close. 
“All right, let’s talk about what we’re going to do from here on 
out.”
The other two peered at the map with serious expressions on 
their faces. We’d done this enough that I expected them to be sick of 
it, but even Eris—someone with no patience for complex 
conversations—was listening in with a solemn look on her face.
“There are three routes from here to the Asura Kingdom,” I 
explained, pointing at the map I’d just purchased. It was a simple 
map with rough outlines of forests and village locations. The 
manufacture and sale of detailed maps was strictly prohibited in this 
country, so as to prevent other countries from possibly getting hold 
of those maps. Well, it didn’t matter as long as we knew the basic lay 
of the land.
“The first is a highway primarily used as a trade route.” I used 
my finger to trace the path, which detoured east around the King 
Dragon Mountains. “This is the safest route. Based on our travelling 
speed, we’d arrive in ten months’ time.” 
“Why do we have to go around like that?” Eris asked, 
understandably doubtful. 
I pointed to the western flank of the mountains. “Because if we 
detour to the west, we’ll run into a large forest. That’s the second 
possible route.” 
A vast, dense forest spread across the land west of the King 
Dragon Mountains, making it impossible to travel by carriage. If you 
were familiar with the path, you could take months off the journey 
by taking this route, but that would require riding on horseback. Eris 
and I couldn’t do that. Ruijerd could probably ride a horse, but no 
matter how small I was, there was no way three of us could fit on 
one horse. If we were going to take that route, we’d have to take it 
on foot.  
I had no way of figuring out how many days that would take, but 
I knew that basically everyone chose the safe eastern route over the 
alternatives. Either taking the other routes didn’t actually save much 
time, or the eastern path itself was actually faster. Slow and steady 
wins the race, as they say. That was how I summarized my 
explanation, at least.
“Okay, then scratch the western path,” Eris agreed.
“As for the third possible route…” It would involve taking a ship 
to the Begaritt Continent, and then trekking overland to the Asura 
Kingdom. I had no idea how long this path would take. “I’m crossing 
it off our list of options.”
“How come?!”
“Because it’s dangerous,” I said. Mana was even thicker on the 
Begaritt Continent than it was on the Demon Continent. The average 
strength of the beasts there was on par with those of the Demon 
Continent, but there were numerous underground labyrinths that 
created bizarre weather patterns on the surface. 
The climate there could easily be described in one word: desert. 
The entire continent was one enormous desert. There were gigantic 
scorpions the size of a Great Tortoise, and masses of enormous 
worms that preyed primarily on said scorpions. The days were 
scorching hot and the nights were Arctic cold. There were almost no 
oases, so there was nowhere to stop and rest. As one approached 
the Asura Kingdom, the sand gave way to a snow-covered terrain 
with freezing temperatures, and there would be fewer and fewer 
monsters to hunt for food. 
“Thus, we’re going to take the eastern route.”
“As usual, you’re a coward,” Eris complained.
“I’m just faint of heart.”
“I think I could do it just fine.” It seemed Eris wanted to see the 
Begaritt Continent. Her eyes were alight. However, the distance 
between the Central Continent and the Millis Continent was nothing 
compared to the distance between here and the Begaritt Continent. 
“We’d be on a ship for a long time if we chose that route. Are you 
sure you’d be okay with that, Eris?”
“…We’re not going to Begaritt.”
And that was how we decided we were taking the eastern route.
Before I realized what was happening, I was in a pure white 
room. Emotion welled from the depths of my body. It was such a 
familiar sensation that I could easily describe it. 
So damn disgusting.
“Already resorting to foul language? Just as crass as ever, I see.”
Standing before me was an indistinct, person-shaped mosaic: 
the Man-God.
Tch, acting like you know me. Can’t believe you’re showing up 
again, just when I’d finally started to forget about you.
“Yes, it’s been a whole year.”
Yes, a whole year. Such a long time. Tell me, do you only show 
up once a year? If so, that would put my heart at ease.
“No, that’s not the case at all.”
I figured as much. After the first time you appeared, you 
showed yourself again just a week later.
“That aside, you’re as cold to me as ever. It’s all thanks to me 
that you got that demon eye, you know.”
Yeah, well, I’m grateful for that…but if you’d told me more, I 
wouldn’t have ended up in that cell, and I wouldn’t have missed 
important information that led to my fight with Paul. Ah, dammit, I  
bet you found the whole thing really entertaining: Paul and I butting 
heads because I didn’t know my family was missing, me being all 
depressed afterward and Eris cheering me up…even managing to 
make up with Paul in the end.
“Well, yes, that was entertaining. But are you sure about that?”
Sure about what?
“Sure that it’s all my fault?”
Tch… Dammit. Being in this room takes me back to the past.
Back to when I used to blame everything on other people. I’ve 
reflected on my mistakes. Reflected… Argh, dammit, I can’t 
remember what kind of reflection I did. Why can’t I… Dammit, 
dammit!
“Well, that’s part of your charm. But a little reflection won’t be 
enough for you to move forward.”
Whatever. It’s just that I can’t remember right now. But I will 
when I wake up. I can recognize my mistakes. So, let’s restart our 
conversation. I’ve decided to listen to you.
“Listen? Hmm, now this is different. You’re honestly going to 
listen to what I have to say?”
Yeah, that’s right. But there’s one thing I want you to tell me.
“What’s that? I don’t mind answering if it’s something I have 
knowledge about.”
Tell me where my family is.
“I thought your family was in another world?”
Don’t play games with me. Zenith, Lilia and Aisha. If possible, 
Sylphie, Ghislaine, Philip, and Sauros, too.
“Hmm.”
What? I’m asking sincerely. 
“I don’t know if I should tell you…” 
You’re just a voyeur who spies on people’s lives! Are you only 
going to tell me things that are convenient for you? You can arrange 
for me to meet up with the World’s Greatest Demon Emperor, but 
you can’t tell me where my family is?
“Okay, okay, I’m sorry. I got a little carried away.”
Good, as long as you know what you did.
“But are you sure? I might lie to you this time.”
What! Lie?! So, you finally admit it! That’s right, you are the 
type to lie, aren’t you?
“I’m asking whether you can trust what I say.”
No, I can’t trust you. This is an emergency, so I’ll do as you say, 
but if it turns out you’re lying to me, I’ll never listen to your advice 
again. Got it?
“Then I want you to promise me something.”
Promise you what?
“If my advice allows you to reunite with your family, then I want 
you to trust me from now on.”
Are you telling me to be your little puppet? Be your yes-man 
and obey your every command?
“No, no, I’m not asking you to go that far. But it’s going to get 
exhausting if you’re this hostile every time we talk, you know?”
It’ll be exhausting even if I’m not. Do you even know what it’s 
like? To be haunted by a past you want to forget? To feel like the 
memories of your repentance and growth have been erased? To be 
overwhelmed by self-loathing the moment you wake up in the 
morning?
“I see. I’ve wronged you. All right, then why don’t we decide on 
some rules? Like me telling you ahead of time when I’ll next drop in 
to give you advice?”
Yes, that’s a wonderful idea! How about coming to see me 
again in a hundred years? 
“But you’ll be dead by then, no?”
I’m telling you to never show your face again.
“Sigh… Well, I figured you’d say that. Are you sure you don’t 
want any advice from me this time?”
…No. Hold on a sec. I’m sorry. I’ll compromise. If you can give 
me advice this time that will reunite me with a member of my family, 
then I’ll stop being so hostile when we talk.
“And you’ll trust me?”
Nope, I’m not willing to go that far. But I’ll at least stop having 
these meaningless exchanges about whether or not I’m going to 
listen.
“Well, that’s optimistic.”
So, you compromise, too. Stop showing up out of nowhere like 
you did this time. Give me some prior warning. Or show up in 
someone else’s dreams and use them to pass on a message to me.
“That would be difficult. There’s actually a condition that must 
be met for me to be able to appear in someone’s dreams.”
A condition? So that means you can’t just show your face 
whenever you want?
“Exactly. In addition to that, I can only show up in the dreams of 
someone who is on the same wavelength as I am. There aren’t many 
who can receive my advice with such fortuitous timing. You’re quite 
lucky.”
I could weep for joy. Anyway, there’s a condition, huh? What is 
it?
“Who knows? I’m not even sure myself. All I know is that there’ll 
be a sudden ‘aha!’ moment where I’m like, ‘This guy’s the one, today 
is the time.’ And that’s when I’m able to link up.”
Yeah? So that means you can’t completely control it, either. 
Forget the prior warning, then. Let’s see…I’d like you to be more 
detailed in your advice. If all you say is “go here” or “go there,” it just  
leaves me confused as to what I’m supposed to do. It makes me feel 
like you’re playing me.
“All right, more details. Got it.”
Okay. Go ahead, then.
“Ahem. Well, this is my advice this time.”
A vision suddenly appeared in my demon eye.
A back alley in some country somewhere. There’s a lone girl, 
and someone violently grabs her hand. The person who seized her is a 
soldier. There’re two soldiers. The other one is tearing a piece of 
paper he’d snatched from her into pieces. The girl watches him, 
screaming something.
The vision suddenly ended there.
“Rudeus. Listen to me closely. Her name is Aisha Greyrat. She is 
currently being detained in the Shirone Kingdom. You’ll be there 
when the events from your vision transpire, and you’ll meet her and 
save her. You absolutely must not let your name be known. Call 
yourself the Kennel Master of Dead End and ask her for the details of 
her situation. Then send a letter to your acquaintance in the Shirone 
Royal Palace. If you do that, both Lilia and Aisha will be rescued from 
that place.”
Huh? Wait, what? No—wait, why? Acquaintance? A letter?
“Was that a little too much detail? If I tell you too much, it’ll 
spoil my fun, so that’ll have to do. Now then, I wonder which one 
you’ll get along with…”
What? Lilia and Aisha are both in the Shirone Kingdom? Why? 
If that’s where they were, they should have been found by now. And 
what do you mean, which one am I going to get along with? Does 
that mean I’m going to clash with the other?
“Good luck, Rudeus.” 
Luck…luck…luck…
As the word echoed in my mind, my consciousness faded.
I woke with a start.
“Ugh!”
My head was pounding. The dizziness was overwhelming, and I 
felt nauseated. I climbed out of bed and half-ran straight to the 
bathroom, where I started vomiting into the toilet bowl.
I had a dreadful headache, and my feet were unsteady. When I 
left the bathroom, the trip back to my room felt much longer than it 
had when I raced in here. I pressed my hand against the wall and 
slowly slumped to the floor. In the darkness of the inn, I could hear 
someone panting. Startled, I looked around to find the source, only 
to realize that it was the sound of my own breathing.
“What’s wrong? Are you okay?”
A white face floated in the pitch black of the hallway. It was 
Ruijerd. He was peering at me with a worried look on his face.
“Yeah…I’m fine.”
“What did you eat? Can you use detoxification magic?” He 
pulled a cloth from his pocket and wiped the area around my mouth.
At the whiff of my own vomit, the nausea flared up again. But I 
managed to keep from barfing again, even as the queasiness lingered 
in my chest. “I’m okay.” I somehow managed to wring the words out 
from the depths of my throat.
“Are you sure?” He still sounded worried.
I nodded. I was familiar with this headache. I’d felt it before 
when we were in Wind Port. “Yeah, I was half-asleep and failed to 
moderate my Eye of Foresight. That’s why this happened.”
When I’d previously used the Eye of Foresight to look several 
seconds into the future, it had given me a headache just like this one. 
I had a good idea of why this had happened. The dream, that advice, 
and the vision he made me see—the Man-God showed me the 
future. Most likely using the Eye of Foresight. 
“So that’s why…” I mumbled to myself. Ruijerd gave me a 
puzzled look.
I remembered how I’d met the Great Demon Emperor in the 
port city and obtained my demon eye. I remembered how sudden it 
was and how, for some reason, I’d picked this specific eye. I’d met 
Gallus right after that, but the eye contributed nothing to our 
journey across the sea.
It was true that I’d eventually defeated Gallus using the eye, but 
I felt like I could have managed that on my own if I’d had to. To me, 
there was no greater meaning behind my acquisition of the demon 
eye, but perhaps there was to the Man-God. Perhaps the whole 
reason he’d arranged for me to meet the Great Demon Emperor was 
so he could use the eye to show me the future. It sure did feel like he 
was making careful preparations for something.
My anxiety reared its ugly head, and for the first time, I feared 
the Man-God. I got the impression that this being, this creature with 
undefined form and incredible power, was trying to use me for 
something. It sent a chill through me.
“Rudeus, you look pale. Are you sure you’re okay?” Ruijerd 
asked again, looking concerned.
I almost blurted out my anxieties. The truth is that ever since I 
met you, the Man-God has been monitoring me. I’ve been following 
his advice and doing what he tells me. 
But in that moment, I realized something. Ever since I met you. 
That was it. The first time we came into contact was right before I 
met Ruijerd. Back then, the god had also advised me to help Ruijerd 
out.
Now, that was strange. Why didn’t he contact me before that? 
Why did he only contact me right after the Displacement Incident? 
Why advise me to help Ruijerd rather than just rely on him?
I felt like all of these things were connected. I had no proof of 
this, but despite that, a thought occurred to me. Maybe the ManGod plans to make Ruijerd do something.
The Man-God said he could only appear in my dreams if a 
certain condition were met. Perhaps he was bound by that condition 
so he couldn’t manipulate Ruijerd directly. So he triggered the 
Displacement Incident to transport me—someone who did fit that 
criteria— to the Demon Continent, and guided me to Ruijerd, 
thereby getting him to accompany us to the Central Continent. 
But if that were the case, why help me acquire the demon eye 
or give me advice on how to save Aisha? I didn’t know. I didn’t know 
what he was thinking. Nor was I sure if I should say anything to 
Ruijerd.
“…”
I wanted to confide in someone, but I didn’t think it was right to 
put more on Ruijerd’s shoulders. Maybe telling him would even fulfill 
the Man-God’s unknown conditions, and the god would be able to 
talk directly to Ruijerd. Honestly, Ruijerd would probably be easily 
taken in by whatever the Man-God said to him. I wasn’t even entirely 
convinced he was telling me the truth, but at least my hostility made 
it difficult for him to deceive me. I wanted to believe that as long as I 
kept that up, nothing too terrible would happen.
“Mister Ruijerd, if you ever find yourself in a difficult situation 
and someone whispers honeyed words in your ear, don’t ever 
believe what they say. Deceitful people strategically target you when 
you’re the most vulnerable.”
In the end, I didn’t tell him about the Man-God.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about, but I understand.” 
I had mixed feelings, watching him look at me so earnestly and 
nod. Ruijerd trusted me, and yet I was hiding things from him. It was 
largely because I’d determined keeping them secret was the best 
course of action, but that didn’t alleviate the guilt.
My headache and nausea had faded without my noticing. Now 
my thoughts weighed heavily for a different reason. I returned to my 
room, but even after I crawled back into bed, I didn’t feel like 
sleeping. My eyes were wide open, and ideas churned in my head. 
When I closed my eyes, they floated in front of me, one after the 
other.
“Whah ish it…”
I heard someone talking in their sleep. Eris was sprawled in the 
bed beside me, snoring away. Her sleeping posture was as poor as 
ever, legs spread wide open. Rather than pajamas, she wore a pair of 
shorts, her toned legs poking out, and a dangerous gap at the hem 
where you could peek further inside. Her shirt was riding up, 
exposing her adorable belly button. Even if you looked straight down 
at her, you could see the curves of her chest. She didn’t wear a bra to 
bed, so if I squinted hard enough, I could see the small peaks of the 
tips of her breasts. I could also see the drool dribbling down her chin 
as she grinned in her sleep.
“Mmph.”
I smiled wryly at her sleep-talk and rose out of bed. I pulled her 
shirt back down and readjusted the blanket over her.
“Rudeus…is a perv…”
She had a dirty look on her face. Here I was, making myself sick 
with worry, and she still called me a perv. 
I was tempted to touch her breasts so my actions would at least 
warrant that accusation, but a wave of drowsiness came over me. I 
yawned and collapsed back into my bed. 
Eris was impressive as ever. No sooner had I thought that than I 
was asleep.
24    
The next day dawned.
As we grabbed breakfast at a pub, I announced, “We’re going to 
stop by the Shirone Kingdom.”
Ruijerd and Eris both tilted their heads but still nodded. “Okay. 
Fine.” “Understood.”
Neither one of them asked why or for what purpose. I actually 
appreciated that. I had already decided that I would avoid talking 
about the Man-God as much as possible, but still fretted over how to 
explain my actions without bringing him up.
Ruijerd probably had his own theories after seeing me last night. 
He’d probably already realized that I was hiding something—though 
it was entirely possible he just thought I was hiding some kind of 
illness. Not entirely incorrect, given that the Man-God was like a 
plague bearer.
“Shirone—you mean that place where your master’s at, right?”
As Eris said it, the image of a certain young girl came to mind: 
Roxy Migurdia. That was right. She was supposed to be in Shirone. 
The Man-God had said to send a letter to my acquaintance. He must 
have meant for me to plead with Roxy for her assistance. 
“That’s right. Someone I really respect. My…teacher.” I’d almost 
said the word “master,” but caught myself in time. Come to think of 
it, Roxy forbade me from calling her my master. Though “master” 
was exactly the term I’d used when telling everyone how wonderful 
she was lately… Oh, well.
“We should stop by and meet them. They might be able to help 
us somehow.” Eris nodded to herself in satisfaction.
Someone as incredible as Roxy would surely be of great help to 
us. I was certain of it. She was also, however, a magician at the royal 
25    
palace, and had to be busy. I didn’t want to trouble her too much—
she’d already done so much for me. 
Regardless of the Displacement Incident or the search for my 
family, I still wanted to see her. I also wanted to thank her for her 
Dictionary of Demonkind. If she hadn’t given me that book, I might 
still be on the Demon Continent right now. I regretted losing it in the 
incident—it deserved to be copied and sold worldwide.
“I want to see your teacher,” Eris said.
“Hm. I’m interested in meeting them, too.”
Both Eris and Ruijerd seemed intrigued, probably because I 
invoked Roxy’s name with praise every now and then. I was so proud 
to call her my teacher, and so I mentioned her everywhere I went. 
That was a given.
“All right, then. When we get to Shirone Kingdom, I’ll introduce 
you.”
As I made that promise, the three of us set off.
   
First, we proceeded along the highway which took us straight 
through Wyvern, the capital of the King Dragon Realm. From there, 
the route veered around the King Dragon Mountains and split off. 
One path stretched straight up north, and another led out west. We 
selected the northern route that led to Shirone.
We wound up unexpectedly spending seven whole days in the 
capital city of Wyvern. Our initial plan was to leave after three days, 
but there was an issue with our carriage and the repairs took some 
time. I could’ve done the adjustments myself had the carriage been 
made from stone or steel, but there was nothing magic could do to 
fix something made of wood.
26    
We paid extra to rush the repairs. It still took seven days for 
them to be completed, but there was no reason to be hasty. In the 
vision that the Man-God showed me, Aisha was surrounded by two 
men. I was worried, but the god had said I would be there when it 
happened. In that case, perhaps our carriage troubles were the work 
of fate. If fate was involved, then no matter how quickly I rushed to 
Shirone, I wouldn’t meet her before it was time. 
I had to stay as calm as possible. With that in mind, I made my 
way around Wyvern. 
The King Dragon Realm was the third biggest country in this 
world, and the largest in the southern part of the Central Continent, 
with four vassal states under it. Once, this country had been just one 
of many in the south. That changed after it attacked the King Dragon 
Mountains in the northwest and slew their ruler, Kajakt the Monarch 
of the King Dragons. This gave his conquerors access to a huge vein 
of minerals, instantaneously boosting their country’s resources and 
power. It was also the origin of forty-eight magical swords that were 
now scattered about the world, as well as one of the places 
mentioned in a line of the Epic of the North God. 
Despite this storied past, the country didn’t seem like it put too 
much emphasis on tradition. Instead it felt like America—like a mix 
of different elements. There were many smithies and sword training 
halls, and the styles were diverse, but most of the techniques I saw
belonged to the North God Style or Water God Style. I tried peeking 
into one of the training halls, but most of the people being taught 
were children. Even the masters of those halls were mostly only 
Advanced-tier swordfighters, so Eris took one look at them and said, 
with a snort of laughter, “They’re nothing special.” Even Ruijerd 
expressed disapproval.
At any rate, I decided to gather information on missing persons. 
I found one of Paul’s underlings in the Adventurers’ Guild who told 
me there was no information to be found in this country. It wasn’t 
27    
going to be easy to find anyone who was still missing after all this 
time.
Following that, I did my usual market research. Specialty goods 
from both the Millis Continent and the Central Continent were sold 
here. It was among the wide variety of food being sold in the 
marketplace that I made a discovery: rice. Its color was a bit yellow, 
but it was definitely rice. 
Of course, I already knew there was rice in this country. I’d 
eaten white rice when I was in East Port. I had really been looking 
forward to eating this country’s cuisine, but unfortunately the only 
things their pubs served were easy-made soups, paella, and rice 
porridge. A bit different from what I was looking for. I wanted to eat 
pure white rice. 
The moment I saw the rice for sale, an electric shock ran 
through me. If I couldn’t buy cooked white rice, then I just needed to 
make it myself. I bought the rice instantly. 
A few hours later, I was in the inn’s garden, preparing my food. I 
had 4.5 grams of rice, cooking utensils I’d carefully prepared with 
earth magic, an outdoor stove, a recipe that a pub owner taught me, 
eggs, and salt. I held the recipe in one hand while I washed the rice 
and started the fire in the stove. The heat of the fire was key to 
cooking rice properly.
“What are you doing?”
I had my game face on as Eris came over. “An experiment,” I 
said.
“Hmm?” She huffed in disinterest and started swinging her 
arms. Judging by the way she kept stealing glances at me, she was 
actually more curious than she let on.
I turned over the hourglass I’d borrowed from the pub owner 
and powered up the fire. The pub owner said that the trick to 
28    
cooking rice was slowly turning up the heat, so I was following his 
advice. After turning over the hourglass three times, I lowered the 
heat. Then I turned it over two more times. Finally, I extinguished the 
flames and turned it over another two times.
“It’s done,” I said.
“Really?” Eris stopped swinging her arms and stooped beside 
me. Her scent wafted toward me, but my hunger was currently 
stronger than my sex drive. 
She looked at the pot in anticipation. I was also filled with 
excitement as I lifted the lid. The wave of heat carried the smell of 
freshly cooked rice right to my nose.
“It smells really good. Good job, Rudeus.”
“No, I need to taste it first,” I said, pinching a bit of rice between 
my fingers and popping it into my mouth. “Hmm…I’d give it a fortyfive out of one hundred.” 
It was nowhere near as good as the two types of Japanese rice 
that stood out in my memory: Koshihikari and Sasanishiki. Even if I 
compared it to all the modern types of Japanese rice, it wouldn’t 
even be C-ranked. It was dry, had a kind of bitterness to it, and was 
still faintly yellow in color. My poor cooking methods were partly to 
blame, but the ingredients themselves were inferior too, perhaps 
because rice wasn’t a staple in this country. You couldn’t even call 
this white rice.
In truth I should have given it only thirty points, which would 
have been a failing grade. But tasting rice at all evoked such nostalgia 
that I couldn’t. With a bit of seasoning, it could earn fifteen more 
points. Ah, I really am too kind, I mused inwardly.
“We ate this before, right? What kind of experiment was this?”
“This is just the beginning.”
29    
I heaped the rice into an earthen bowl I’d made. Then I took a 
scrambled raw egg, which I’d cast detoxification magic on just in 
case, and created a hole in the middle of the rice before pouring in 
the mixture. I sprinkled salt all over the top, took the chopsticks I’d 
also made with my magic, and put both hands together.
“Here we go.”
“Huh? But, Rudeus, that egg is…raw…!”
I opened my mouth wide and took a huge bite of the now 
brightly yellow-colored rice. Hmm…it smelled questionable. The salt 
I’d added to it didn’t seem to do anything. 
Now that I was trying it, I noticed the flavor of the egg was 
different, too. It was a far cry from the fresh ones sold in Japan for 
raw consumption. I should probably cast detoxification again on 
myself afterward just to be safe. Also, it definitely needed soy sauce, 
without which the raw taste was all too apparent. 
I wondered if soy sauce existed in this world as well. If it didn’t, 
then maybe I could find some kind of substitute?
“Does it taste good?”
Since Eris had asked, I used my earth magic to make another 
bowl. I spooned in some rice, added some salt and offered it to her. I 
also passed her a spoon I’d made—this would be beginner-friendly, 
no chopsticks.
“Hey…is this really all there is to it?”
Gulp!
I nodded quietly. Though I wasn’t proud of it, there had been a 
point in my former life when I subsisted solely on rice for meals and 
rice balls for snacks. 
“Hmm…” Eris chewed slowly, mixed emotions on her face. Her 
tastes were still that of a child. Once I broke an egg over it, she did 
30    
say, “This is better than before,” and filled her cheeks with rice as 
she ate it all.
Raw egg mixed with rice really was the best meal ever—and 
perfectly balanced, too. As we said that, we finished our food, 
gobbling down the last of the crunchy, burnt rice on the bottom. 
Ruijerd was the only one who didn’t get to share the meal, but 
he made no complaints. He’s the real adult, I thought. Still, I did feel 
a little guilty. Next time, I’d make sure he got a share.
31    
32    
   
We departed from the King Dragon Realm and took the highway 
up north. There were two more countries between us and the 
Shirone Kingdom: the Sanakia Kingdom and the Kikka Kingdom. They 
were both vassal states to the King Dragon Realm.
Rice cultivation was booming in the Sanakia Kingdom. Its climate 
must have been perfect for it, because the highway was lined with 
rice paddies. There were lots of rivers in the area, so the topography 
was probably similar to Japan and East Asia. The rice was the same as 
the kind I ate in the King Dragon Realm, meaning it was probably 
exported from here. I decided to call it Sanakia rice.
At the inns we stopped at, our meals consisted mainly of 
seafood and rice. I’d learned to eat in moderation since coming to 
this world, but the appeal of rice was just too irresistible, and I ate 
until my stomach was full to bursting.
Eris kept looking over at me, wide-eyed, during mealtimes. 
Perhaps it piqued her interest that I, normally so fussy about food, 
had lately been shoveling it in.
“What’s wrong?” I asked finally.
“I thought you were the type that didn’t really eat much, 
Rudeus.” 
I’d never been a light eater in my previous life, where I always 
came back for another helping as long as there was still food on the 
table. The only reason I’d been practicing moderation since being 
reborn was because this world’s food didn’t suit my palate. Leaving 
aside the tough meat that was a staple of most of our meals on the 
Demon Continent, even the bread-heavy meals of the Asura 
Kingdom felt a bit lacking to me. Zenith’s cooking wasn’t bad, but I 
couldn’t help my longing for rice. 
33    
Ahh, yes. Rice is so wonderful, I thought.
Food wasn’t the only thing I spent my time on. I popped in at 
the Adventurers’ Guild, too. Unsuprisingly, given that this was the 
Central Continent, invoking the name “Dead End” didn’t elicit the 
least bit of shock. Just because someone was famous in America, for 
example, didn’t mean their popularity extended to Japan. Or how 
there were a lot of children who knew about Superman, but didn’t 
know who Captain America was.
They were adventurers, so they’d probably heard the name 
Dead End before. But no one kicked up much of a fuss. Even if they 
knew what the Superd were, the Superd’s most recognizable trait 
was their hair color. Just like a track team girl wasn’t really a track 
team girl to a modern-day Japanese otaku unless she had a black 
ponytail, Ruijerd wasn’t really a Superd without the green hair. 
That said, A-ranked adventurers seemed to be more observant 
than the rest.
“Hey, you guys. Never seen you before. You’re A-ranked, right? 
Did you just form a group recently?” The man who approached us 
had an aura similar to Nokopara’s. Considering how that had gone, I 
wasn’t too keen on getting friendly with him.
“We started two years ago,” I replied.
“Ooh, that’s not something you hear around here. Dead End, 
huh? That’s the name of some fiend from the Demon Continent, 
right?”
“Yes. And we’ve traveled all the way from the Demon Continent 
to get here.”
“Heh heh, saw that one coming. And let me guess, that guy over 
there is the fiend?”
34    
“Yes,” I said, “but could you please refrain from calling him 
that?”
“Why? That’s what you’re trying to pass yourselves off as, 
right?” He laughed as if we were pulling his leg, but I kept a serious 
expression on my face. Eris looked slightly perturbed, and Ruijerd 
looked uncomfortable. 
The man broke into a cold sweat when he saw our reactions. 
“Wait, are you for real?”
“If you don’t believe me, would you like him to show you the 
gem on his forehead?”
“No. No, that’s fine! I just didn’t think he was the real thing. I 
guess the Superd really do exist, then…”
The fact that we’d reached the A-rank on the Demon Continent 
lent more credibility to our claims of Ruijerd being a Superd. Despite 
the harsh treatment demons faced on the Central Continent, people 
didn’t seem as terrified of the Superd here, perhaps because the 
threat of them was so foreign. After all, people who claimed brown 
bears were harmless were generally people who had never 
encountered one in the mountains before.
The name Dead End had lost most of its value, but it would be 
easier to restore Ruijerd’s reputation when people weren’t terrified 
of him. That said, I still hadn’t come up with a good plan for that. The 
Ruijerd figure I’d made wouldn’t be any good as long as we were in 
the domain of the Millis faith, either.
As I was preoccupied with those thoughts, Eris glared at the man 
who had spoken to us. “Eris, please don’t start a fight,” I said.
“Yeah, I know that already.”
“Okay, good.”
Lately, she’d stopped scrapping with the other adventurers. Her 
demeanor had grown tougher this past year. She no longer had the 
35    
look of a novice about her. Just one glance was enough to tell a 
person she was dangerous, so why would they bother approaching? 
For her own part, Eris had also come to understand the 
adventurers’ style of humor. Even if someone said something 
offensive to her, she was now calm enough to realize that she’d 
heard it before. She’d answer their quip with an appropriate 
response, the other person would laugh, and then’d she’d grin back 
at them. She really had become just like an adventurer.
That said, she was always still game if someone wanted to pick a 
fight with her. Some people, most of them C-ranked and young 
themselves, would deliberately approach her after seeing that she 
was A-ranked despite her youth. They’d come up and say something 
like, “I bet you don’t have any skills yourself. You just had those guys 
in your party carry you the whole way, right?” 
This invariably resulted in a one-punch knockout. Somehow, 
morons like this seemed to be in just about every Adventurers’ Guild 
we went to.
As for me, I would just off-handedly respond, “That’s right! The 
master of our party is so incredible, we’re living the high life!” I had 
no pride. Besides, it was true that we’d relied on Ruijerd a lot to 
advance to such a high rank. Eris didn’t seem to like my attitude, but 
there was no way we could have gotten this far by ourselves. Let’s at 
least show some modesty, I thought.
The cultivation of a flower that resembled field mustard was 
widespread in the Kikka Kingdom. From the highway, we saw endless 
fields of white flowers in bloom. Definitely a flourishing industry, but 
also one the kingdom had been compelled to invest in by the King 
Dragon Realm. The abundant rice paddies in the Sanakia Kingdom 
had also been planted on the Realm’s command. Being a vassal state 
was rough.
36    
Rice was a staple in this country’s cuisine, too. Upon testing it, I 
realized that the further north you went, the better the quality of the 
rice. Perhaps the day when I would experience love at first bite with 
rice this world wasn’t far. Unfortunately, the northern part of the 
Central Continent was currently split into a bunch of tiny countries 
engaged in continuous minor conflicts. There was no way they could 
cultivate delicious rice under those circumstances. Truly a pity.
There was a dish called Nanahoshiyaki that was popular all the 
way from the King Dragon Realm to the Kikka Kingdom. It was meat 
covered in rice flour and wheat flour, and fried in oil at a high 
temperature. In other words, karaage—Japanese fried chicken. 
Apparently, the dish was developed in the Asura Kingdom and gained 
huge popularity there before making it all the way here. It required 
an abundance of cooking oil to make, but since a neighboring 
country produced vast amounts of the dish, there were plenty of 
opportunities to eat it in this region.
Unfortunately, this “fried chicken” didn’t taste so good, either. 
The meat used was mostly sheep, pig, or horse. There was no set 
temperature for the frying, so sometimes the dish came out hard 
and other times it came out gooey. It also wasn’t properly seasoned, 
even though you could use salt, dried herbs, or the sauce that was 
unique to the area to change the flavor. The food we’d had in East 
Port suddenly didn’t seem so bad by comparison. Quite the opposite, 
in fact.
Being a bit of a gourmand, I understood that the cooks in this 
country were trying their best. Still, what they delivered wasn’t what 
I longed for. The lack of soy sauce was impossible to overlook. If I 
only had soy sauce, garlic, and ginger for seasoning, then I could 
make something salty and sweet.
“Lately, you get this troubled look on your face whenever we 
eat, Rudeus.”
37    
“He’s picky about flavor,” Ruijerd chimed in. “He’s probably got 
some opinions about it.”
“I think it’s pretty good,” Eris responded.
We sat around a table, the two of them gulping down their 
food. They weren’t picky at all. I hadn’t come all this way to be a food 
critic and pass judgment on every meal, but I couldn’t help but think 
how much better it would be with just a little bit of soy sauce.
“But the texture of the food is amazing. It’s crunchy, and then 
when you bite into it the juice just fills your mouth.”
“Yeah, it’s good,” Ruijerd agreed.
They both asked for seconds and cleaned their bowls in no time 
flat. How fortunate they were. They could find this kind of food 
delicious because it was the first time they’d ever had it. I, knowing 
there was better out there, couldn’t be content.
I couldn’t help my cravings for white rice and fried chicken with 
soy sauce, or for tofu and miso soup with seaweed in it. My 
insatiable quest for good food continued alongside my search for 
missing persons, which, of course, yielded absolutely no information.
That was how things went for four months. Then, finally, we 
reached the Shirone Kingdom.
38    
The Shirone Kingdom was a small but old country with a 
two-hundred-year history. This was notable because all the human 
countries except for the Asura Kingdom and the Holy Country of 
Millis had been wiped out in the war four hundred years ago. 
The southern part of the Central Continent had been ripe with 
conflict until the King Dragon Realm took control of the whole region 
some three hundred years ago. Even now, the land to the north of 
here was a sprawling region of discord. The Shirone Kingdom was 
close to the Conflict Zone. Given its precarious location, how had this 
kingdom endured for two hundred years? The answer lay in the 
alliance it formed with the King Dragon Realm right after it was 
founded—an alliance in name only. Much like the other two 
countries we’d had to cross through to get here, the Shirone 
Kingdom was basically a vassal state to the King Dragon Realm.
That said, I had very little interest in national politics. The only 
thing I cared about was the fact that Roxy was in this country. I 
wondered if my young—wait, no. She wasn’t actually young, was 
she? Anyway, I wondered if my adorable, clumsy master was still a 
court magician here. She’d said the prince was giving her trouble, but 
I was sure she could handle that.
It’d been so long. I wanted to see her. I wanted to see her and 
tell her I was all right. I wanted to tell her about how I visited her 
hometown. I wanted her to show me the King-tier magic that she’d 
said she could use now. My heart thrummed with anticipation as we 
made our way down the road toward the capital.
Along the side of the highway were disjointed rice fields and 
grazing livestock. There were also inactive plots of land and pastures 
full of plants that looked like clover. I wasn’t too well-versed in 
39    
agricultural practices, but the people of this world seemed to be 
putting some thought into how they grew their crops.
Although supposedly a vassal state of the King Dragon Realm, 
the Shirone Kingdom didn’t really have the vibe of a colony, unlike 
the two countries we’d passed through before. Maybe it was 
because it was so far away, or because it was being used as a buffer 
between the Conflict Zone and other countries. At any rate, such was 
the landscape that accompanied us as we arrived at the capital, 
Latakia.
In this world, most major cities were surrounded by protective 
ramparts, including Roa and Millishion. Even the larger cities in the 
Kikka Kingdom and Sanakia Kingdom had walls around them. The 
same was true of the Shirone Kingdom’s capital, which had a sturdy, 
awe-inspiring wall lining its perimeter.
In hindsight, it was the same way on the Demon Continent. In 
fact, because the continent had such a high concentration of 
powerful monsters, their defenses were more thorough. There 
wasn’t a city out there that could match the huge natural walls that 
surrounded the city of Rikarisu. Each city on the continent utilized 
the special abilities of the tribes living nearby to erect strong walls to 
protect itself. Even small settlements conducted daily exterminations 
of beasts around the village’s outskirts. In comparison, the ramparts 
on the Central Continent looked as if they were merely for show.
We passed through those walls and made our way into the city, 
where we parked our carriage at a stable. There were many 
labyrinths in the vicinity of the city, so there were plenty of toughlooking adventurers around, many of whom engaged primarily in 
dungeon diving. That had been Paul and Ghislaine’s life in the past, 
and even Roxy had done it for a while. I was pretty sure it was Paul 
who’d said dungeon divers were incredibly skilled.
40    
There were many labyrinths scattered throughout Shirone, and 
you could make a ridiculous amount of money just by exploring their 
topmost levels. There were probably a handful of S-ranked 
adventurers among the dungeon divers who were aiming for the 
most lucrative loot, and we mingled with that crowd as we traveled 
the main road and selected a random inn to stay at. As usual, it was 
one tailored to D-ranked adventurers. Even the low-ranked inns in 
this town were a bit pricey, perhaps because there were so many 
high-ranking adventurers around.
Compared to the D-ranked accommodations on the Demon 
Continent, the quality of the lodgings on the Central Continent 
wasn’t bad at all. It was actually good enough that we would have 
been fine with rooms aimed at lower-ranked adventurers, but we 
had enough money not to worry about that. Quite the opposite. In 
fact, we could have afforded even better accommodations if we 
wanted.
I would like to stay in a better room, I thought to myself at one 
point, but even though we had the extra coin, it felt like a waste. 
Maybe I really was a penny pincher.
“All right! Now that we’ve arrived in the Shirone Kingdom, let’s 
conduct our strategy meeting,” I announced to the two standing in 
front of me. Their apathetic applause told me they’d gotten quite 
used to this setup. “Now, what should we start with?”
“We’re going to meet your teacher, right?”
Eris’ question reminded me of what the Man-God had said. 
“Her name is Aisha Greyrat. Currently, she is being detained in the 
Shirone Kingdom. You’ll be there when the events from your vision 
transpire, and you’ll meet her and save her. You absolutely must not 
let your name be known. Call yourself the Kennel Master of Dead End 
and ask her for details on her situation. Then send a letter to your 
acquaintance in the Shirone Royal Palace. If you do that, both Lilia 
41    
and Aisha will be saved from that palace.” Something along those 
lines.
If I trusted his advice in its entirety, then I just had to walk down 
the alleyway I saw in the vision to trigger that event. I figured I 
should probably take Eris and Ruijerd along as well. After all, the 
Man-God said nothing about going alone this time.
I continued to think. If I believed the Man-God, then Lilia and 
Aisha were being detained at the Shirone Royal Palace. But in my 
vision, I’d met Aisha outside. That meant she’d somehow managed 
to escape the palace. I remembered the look of the two men who 
came after her in my dream. I’d seen their getup numerous times in 
the city; it was a normal soldier’s attire.
In other words, Aisha would be pursued and then caught by 
palace soldiers. That was when I would come in. If I took the most 
obvious approach to save her, I’d risk making an enemy of the 
palace, which had to be why the Man-God had said not to use my 
name. It might be best if I hid my face, too. 
While the knights were busy tracking my fake identity, I could 
send a letter to my acquaintance in the palace (Roxy) and ask her for 
help. If she was a court magician, then her words should hold some 
power. I already owed her so much. I didn’t want to show up 
barefoot and dirty-soled at her doorstep, like a stray child—though I 
would happily wash her feet if our positions were reversed.
This was the Man-God we were talking about, though. It was 
possible he was up to something. If I tell you too much, it’ll spoil my 
fun, he’d said. In other words, he was hoping for something 
interesting to happen, and there was probably nothing I could do to 
avoid it. 
However, he’d also said, I hope you’ll trust me next time. 
Hopefully, even if there were unpleasant surprises lying in store for 
42    
me, they wouldn’t involve such things as serious injury or the death 
of someone close to me.
But this was all assuming I trusted the jerk. He might just be 
trying to deceive me this time, with no care for what happened after. 
Even so, there was no point in putting up needless resistance that 
might make everything catastrophically worse. I disliked feeling like I 
was playing into his hands again, but it seemed I had no choice but to 
listen.
My main goals were now to search for Aisha, to falsify my name, 
and to send a letter to Roxy. That said, how was I going to convince 
my companions? The letter wasn’t a problem, but I still needed a 
good reason for searching the back alleys while using a fake name. 
Ever since we’d set out from Millishion, they’d made sure one of 
them was always by my side, even on our free days. Apparently, they 
were still concerned by how depressed I’d gotten after my encounter 
with Paul. 
I felt bad about having worried them, but there was a high 
probability we’d end up facing off with some soldiers in our quest to 
find Aisha. Neither Eris nor Ruijerd was any good at acting. No matter 
who I took, it seemed likely they’d do something that would come 
back to bite us in the butt. Karma had a way of doing that.
Now then…what to do?
“Rudeus, what are you worrying about?”
Hm…well, it’s like they say, better to act now and worry later, I 
reasoned with myself.
“Actually, I’d like for us to conceal our names while we’re here.”
“We’re going to be pretending again? Why?”
“Umm…” Even if I had to keep mum about the Man-God, there 
was no reason I had to hide the rest of the story. “Actually, I heard 
from a source that members of my family have been taken captive 
somewhere in this country.”
43    
“Really?” asked Eris. 
“Oh,” grunted Ruijerd.
Neither asked from whom or where I got this information, even 
though one or the other of them had always been with me whenever 
I gathered information. But it was better for me if they didn’t press 
the issue.
“Oh, I get it!” Eris exclaimed. “They’ll be on alert if they hear the 
name Greyrat, then!”
“That’s right.”
“So, who’s the family?”
“Lilia and Aisha. Our former maid and my little sister.” Actually, 
now that I thought about it, what was I supposed to call Lilia 
anyway? She wasn’t really my stepmother.
“Your little sister? You mean the one who was so full of herself, 
whom we met back in Millishion?”
“I have one more.”
“Uh-huh…” Eris looked unenthused as she pursed her lips.
So Norn seemed full of herself? I didn’t think that at all, but Eris 
clearly had a different impression. I wondered whose side I would 
take if Eris were to punch her…
Eris snorted triumphantly. “Well, if that’s what’s going on, no 
complaints here! Impressive, Rudeus. You really thought this 
through.” So she said, but I was really only being strung along by the 
Man-God. “So we’ll hide our names. Should we be using fake ones?”
“Yes, and it’d be best to go with something common,” I 
reasoned.
“How come?”
“It’s supposedly better if fake names aren’t memorable.” 
44    
“What were some of the famous names around these parts?” 
Eris wondered out loud.
“While we were traveling, I heard names like Shyna and Reidar a 
lot,” Rudeus offered.
Shyna, Knight of the Death God, was a female knight who 
appeared frequently in the Epic of the North God. She was one of 
three North God knights, and used to be one of the God’s 
companions. No matter how brutal the battle, she would always 
return home, almost as if she were unkillable. The story was 
probably ficticious, but there were still many who named their child 
Shyna in hopes that the name might keep them from being killed in 
some freak accident.
Reidar was the name of a Water God. He was a genius at 
countering attacks, could freeze the ocean and walk on top of it, and 
was the hero who vanquished the Sea King Dragon. The name of that 
legendary man was passed on through the generations. Each new 
head of the Water God Style would inherit it: men would be called 
Reidar while women would be called Reida. It was quite a common 
name around here.
The two were putting a lot of thought into the fake names they 
would use. I was grateful for that. Now I needed to give mine some 
serious thought, too.
“Rudeus, what are you going to do?”
“Well, let’s see. In this case, it might better they know right off 
the bat that it’s a fake name.”
“How come?”
“They don’t know our names or our faces. It might confuse them 
if we give them a fake, flashy name to go off of,” I said, quoting a line 
from some super old anime I’d seen a long time ago. To be totally 
honest, it didn’t really matter as long as the names were fake.
“Then we should pick a cool name.”
45    
A cool name, huh? “All right then. I’ll call myself the Knight of 
the Shadow Moon.”
“Knight of the Shadow Moon?!” Eris’ cheeks flushed and her 
eyes sparkled.
That was a character from Kamen Rider who loved haikus and 
wore what looked like a tacky lunch lady uniform. If someone like 
that appeared in front of Eris, she’d probably clobber them.
“I’ll do the same one! Wait, but we can’t be the same, um…”
Did she really like it that much? In that case, might as well stick 
with the knight theme. “Okay then. Eris, you can be the Sword of the 
Shadow Moon and Ruijerd can be the Lance of the Shadow Moon. 
Then we all match.”
“Very nice, we match! Let’s use those!”
I thought Ruijerd might be embarrassed by such a name, but he 
didn’t look too bothered. Paul had said that Aqua Heartia was a cool 
name. Apparently, the concept of “nerds” didn’t exist in this world.
“But you don’t seem like a knight at all, Rudeus,” Eris muttered, 
after I thought we’d settled it.
Not a knight, huh? Maybe I should name myself Evil Magician or 
General Omega instead? Then again, I had no idea if I’d even end up 
using the name. If it didn’t work, I could always use Kennel Master 
instead. 
“Okay. We’ve decided on our fake names, then.”
“What do we do next?”
“For now, I’ll send a letter to Roxy at the royal palace. We’ll 
spend our time gathering information until I get a reply,” I declared. 
   
46    
I went to the market the next day, purchased some stationery 
and an envelope, and started penning my letter to Roxy. I started off 
with seasonal greetings, asked after her well-being, and then 
informed her that, although I’d been teleported, I was safe. I told her 
that I was now in Shirone’s capital and wanted to meet her. Hoping 
to rouse her concern and anxiety, I casually mentioned how 
everyone from Buena Village was missing, and how none of them 
had been found despite the ongoing search. Then I broached the 
topic of our maid, Lilia, and closed by emphasizing one final time 
(because this was important) how worried I was about my family. I 
also structured the letter so that the first letter of each line, if read 
vertically, would read “HELP ME.” With all that I had included in my 
letter, I was sure Roxy would understand what I was implying. 
I sealed it with wax that I pressed an imprint of Roxy’s pendant 
into. I briefly considered sending it under a fake name, but I’d be in 
trouble if she threw it away thinking, “Who the hell is that?” So I 
signed it, Your Beloved Pupil Rudeus Greyrat, Who Just Wants to 
Watch Over You.
Honestly, Roxy would probably recognize my handwriting even 
if I did use a fake name, but it was also just like her to get careless 
when it came to something important. I wouldn’t know if the letter 
would make it to her until she actually had it in her hands. 
Schrödinger’s Roxy. I pictured Roxy sitting in a box that said “please 
pick me up.” Aww. For God’s (Roxy’s) sake—you’re supposed to flip
the box over and hide inside of it. 
Anyway. That aside, there was no harm in making sure she 
would read the contents by leaving my real name on the envelope.
“All right, I’m going to go send this letter off.”
“Okay.”
“All right, be careful!”
47    
The two of them waved at me, Eris with a radiant smile on her 
face. What a letdown. I’d been so sure one of them would want to 
follow me. 
“Eh? What are the two of you going to do?”
“I plan to ask around town about your sister,” Eris said.
That was right—I had said we would be searching for 
information. Information was power, after all, and it never hurt to try 
to gather what we could. I actually felt a little abashed at how lax I’d 
become, trying to move on to the next step without doing that first.
“All right, then. I’ll make sure to hunt down some information 
too, once I’m done sending this letter off.” With that, I left the two of 
them behind.
I went to the Adventurers’ Guild to post the letter. I intended to 
start searching for information afterward, but mere minutes later, I 
realized I was being tailed. At first I thought it was Ruijerd monitoring 
me, probably thinking I might get in trouble if left to my own devices. 
That didn’t make sense after what had happened in the last few 
months, though. He would have joined me rather than tail me in 
secret. Besides, his ability to tail people was second to none. If it 
were truly him following me, there was no way I would have noticed. 
I figured it wasn’t Eris, either. She was terrible at shadowing 
people. I would have noticed her the second I stepped out of the inn, 
and she’d prefer to silently stick right behind me rather than skulk in 
the shadows, anyway. 
So, who was it? Was there someone in this country who had a 
grudge against me…? I couldn’t think of a soul. Besides, I’d only just 
arrived yesterday. It was likely I would stir up trouble in the future, 
but I hadn’t bothered anyone yet.
Was this connected to something I did on the Demon 
Continent? Would someone really follow me all the way here for 
48    
revenge? Unlikely. But maybe they were a survivor from the Zant 
Port smuggling group who’d spotted me by chance. Maybe they 
were planning to seize the opportunity to finish me off. 
No, the most likely explanation was that they had absolutely no 
connection to me at all.
When I turned the corner, I caught a glimpse of a small figure 
ducking into the shadows. It was a child. Maybe one of the 
neighborhood children had decided to pretend I was a bad guy and 
tail me. Or maybe it was an orphan who was planning to swipe my 
wallet. If I hid somewhere, they might panic and pursue me, and I 
could jump out and scare them.
No, wait. This world had races like haflings, who only looked
small. I couldn’t let my guard down. 
I decided that I would give them the slip. With that in mind, I 
took a right at two intersections and then entered a slightly narrow 
alleyway.
“Hm…?”
I got the sudden feeling that something was wrong, a sensation 
like something rising from the depths of my throat.
Brushing it aside, I used magic to create a wall of earth. A threemeter wall rose up, sealing the alley behind me. I heard hurried 
footsteps on the other side as my stalker ran toward the wall, 
followed by the sound of something slapping weakly against it. 
I’d gone pretty deep into the winding alleyways to lose that kid. 
Now, which way back to the main road? I felt a little like a lost child. 
Unlike the grid-like layout in Millishion, even the major 
thoroughfares in this town didn’t run straight. Even someone with a 
good sense of direction, like me, was beginning to get lost. 
I supposed that if it came to it, I could always use magic to boost 
myself onto a roof. Wait. Hang on—this alley was just like the one in 
the vision the Man-God gave me.
49    
“Ah!” 
I realized what the strange feeling from a moment ago had 
been. It was déjà vu.
Turning on my heel, I ran back down the winding alley. I got 
turned around at a T-junction, but managed to retrace my steps to 
the wall of earth I’d created.
“No, stoopp!” I heard a girl scream. “Give it back!”
I put my hand against the solid structure and channeled my 
mana into it. Using earth magic, I weakened the wall’s composition 
while simultaneously using wind magic to trigger a shockwave. With 
a booming crash, the whole thing crumbled and fell away.
Before me was the vision the Man-God had showed me. A 
soldier roughly seized a lone girl’s hand, while another held up some 
paper he’d taken from her, shredding it to pieces.
“That’s for my father! Don’t tear that up!” the girl screamed.
Amidst the echoing of her protests, the soldiers looked my way 
in confusion. “Wh-who the hell are you…?”
The girl had a face that resembled Lilia’s, with Paul’s brown hair 
pulled back into a ponytail. She was wearing a baggy maid’s outfit. 
Her face, which would normally have been light-hearted and gleeful, 
was contorted with tears and streaming snot.
50    
51    
The soldiers had been glaring at her with obscene looks on their 
faces. Wait, no. That wasn’t right. They looked like they pitied her. 
Were they doing this out of duty, rather than because they wanted 
to?
“Who are you?! State your name!”
“I’m that girl’s…” I almost said “brother,” but stopped myself. I 
wasn’t supposed to give away my real name. “Uh…I am the Knight of 
the Shadow Moon!”
“What part of you is a knight? You’re obviously a magician.”
“Ugh…” 
Dammit! Next time, I was definitely going with Evil Magician 
instead!
“Listen up, kid. It’s nice that you want to play hero, but we’re 
soldiers from the palace. This little girl just got lost, so we came to 
escort her home.” 
They clearly considered me nothing more than a mischievous 
child. I was sure they were lying about their intentions, but there was 
a troubled look on the other soldier’s face as he regarded Aisha, who 
was still sobbing. Whatever was going on at the palace to result in 
Lilia and Aisha being detained, it didn’t necessarily mean the soldiers 
in the rank-and-file were bad guys, too. Maybe I should just try to 
talk to them? 
“But you guys tore up the letter she was holding.”
“Ahh…that’s, well, how to explain it? Adults have their reasons.”
Uh-huh. Adults had lots of reasons.
“Ah!”
Aisha found an opening and smacked the soldier’s hand away. 
She hid herself behind me and clung to my waist, her face covered in 
tears and snot. “P-please ’elp!” 
52    
Looking at her helpless expression and frantic demeanor, I 
suddenly didn’t care if I made enemies of this kingdom or not. 
“Doseguhs dook muhledder and dore iddub!”
I had absolutely no idea what she was saying through her 
sobbing, but I could tell she was desperate. Okay. Let’s put an end to 
this. I was an adult on the inside. I couldn’t keep up the charade of a 
child playing at being a hero.
Without warning, I lifted my hand and silently sent a stone 
cannon flying at the soliders.
“Mnh!” The man I’d aimed it at instantly whipped out his sword 
and intercepted the cannon. 
Whoa! That was some reaction speed! Water God Style, huh? 
That was going to make things difficult. But Stone Cannon wasn’t the 
only spell I knew. As long as I had some distance, this would be easy. 
Even though you’re the first person to ever avoid my stone 
cannon, I thought.
“A magician who can use magic without incantations?!”
“Then—could he be the one?!”
“Call for backup!”
“Oka—aaah!”
I created a pit beneath the feet of the soldier who was about to 
try to run away. Whoosh! At the same time, I fired stone cannons in 
rapid succession to divert the other soldier’s attention. As I did that, I 
told Aisha, “We’re going to run. Can you do it?”
“Ngh, wah…yeah…!” She nodded, even through her sobbing.
Very good, very good. All I had to do was knock this one 
unconscious, and we could make our escape. 
Tweeeeee!
53    
No sooner had I thought that than a high-pitched noise like a 
bird’s cry echoed around me. It came from the hole I’d opened up. A 
whistle! That other soldier was blowing an alarm whistle!
Moments later, from all around—both close by and far away—
other whistles joined the chorus. Tweee, tweeeeeet!!
Each one sounded slightly different, probably to let people 
identify their exact locations. Once my opponent saw that I had 
stopped launching stone cannons at him, he yelled, “We’ve created a 
blockade around this area! More soldiers will be here in a moment. 
Cease your futile struggle and hand over the girl! We won’t hurt 
you!”
This area was about to be swarmed. However, I still had a card 
up my sleeve. “Aisha! Hold on tight!”
“Huh?!”
“Don’t let go, no matter what!”
Despite her confusion, Aisha wrapped her arms around my waist 
and squeezed. I grabbed her shirt with my left hand and channeled 
mana into my right. Then, I conjured an earth lance with a flattened 
tip at my feet and used it like a catapult to launch us into the sky.
“Wh-whaat?!”
“Aaaaaaah!”
Ah ha ha! See you later, losers!
Incidentally, I broke both my legs when we landed. I was 
definitely never doing that again.
54    
Aisha cried for quite some time after we made our escape, 
big sobs that shook her whole body. She’d even peed herself. I 
understood how she felt. If a couple of scary men had grabbed my 
arm and threatened me, I’d probably be shaking, too. 
Not enough to pee myself, though.
Those two soldiers were probably more gentlemanly than most, 
but it had to have been a terrifying experience for a five- or six-yearold child. Age gaps felt more pronounced the younger you were—
high-schoolers could be as intimidating as adults to grade-schoolers. 
And the soldiers actually had been adults. 
At least, I wanted to believe that was the reason she was crying
and not the crack of both of my legs breaking when we landed. I 
quickly used healing magic to fix them up, but that definitely hurt.
Currently, I was avoiding mention of her little accident while 
silently washing her underwear. We were back at the inn. Eris and 
Ruijerd were both gone when we made it back, and they’d said they 
were going out to hunt down information, so they probably wouldn’t 
return until evening.
Here I was, having yet another unusual experience. Just 
moments ago, Aisha had peeled off her small, baggy maid outfit. 
Once she shed her soaked underwear, I wiped down her 
undeveloped nethers with a moistened towel and gave her one of 
the shirts I normally wore.
I was left with a wooden pail, some soap, and a young girl’s 
panties. A young, sobbing girl who’d peed herself in bed next to me, 
clad only in my baggy shirt after stripping naked, missing her 
underwear—my former self would have been incredibly turned on by 
55    
this situation. Any dude who found himself in such a situation would 
be, right?
Oh, why didn’t I give her fresh underwear to put on? That’s 
obvious—I didn’t have any for her. I’d been instructed never to touch 
Eris’ panties, after all, and no matter how urgent the situation was, I 
couldn’t break what was one of Dead End’s cardinal rules. The 
thought alone was terrifying. 
Ruijerd wouldn’t save me if I broke that rule. I could use my 
demon eye to try and run, but Eris would be pissed for at least three 
days. If she did manage to punch me while I was defenseless, she’d 
deform my face so bad I wouldn’t be able to taste food for three 
days…granted I’d heal myself well before three days passed. 
Anyway, back to the story. 
The situation was such that it wouldn’t be surprising if my inner 
beast started howling. Yet my heart was as calm as the still surface of 
a lake. Forget being aroused, there wasn’t even a ripple in the water. 
It was as polished and motionless as a mirror. That was odd.
I was troubled by Aisha’s endless sobbing, but I didn’t feel the 
least bit aroused. Had I become some kind of holy man while I wasn’t 
paying attention? Or grown so terrified of rousing Eris's wrath that 
my pocket monster was now incapable of engaging in battle? Had I 
locked away my own memories to avoid facing my terror? No, that 
couldn’t be it. You’re okay down there, right, little buddy? 
Those troublesome thoughts preoccupied me as I washed and 
dried Aisha’s plain linen panties (which weren't sexy in the least) and 
maid uniform (which seemed to be made of high-quality fabric). I 
handed them over to Aisha, who had finally stopped crying at some 
point, and she happily changed into them.
Even watching her do that didn't arouse me at all. Come to think 
of it, I’d never been interested in Zenith’s breasts, either. I hadn’t 
cared much about either gender or age in my previous incarnation, 
56    
but apparently my current body’s family were off-limits in this one. 
Life sure was a mysterious thing.
   
“My name is Aisha Greyrat! Thank you very much!” Dressed in 
her maid uniform, Aisha bowed to me. Her ponytail swayed with the 
motion.
Ponytails really were amazing. Eris occasionally pulled hers back 
into one, but hers made her look like a girl in a sports club. Aisha, on 
the other hand, looked more like an incredibly adorable doll. Her 
eyes were bloodshot, though, so maybe more like a cursed doll?
“Sir Knight, if you hadn’t saved me, they would’ve dragged me 
away back there!”
When she called me “Sir Knight,” I remembered that I’d 
introduced myself as the Knight of the Shadow Moon. A tendril of 
sweat trickled down my back. Maybe I’d gotten too carried away in 
my conversation with Eris. When I thought about how that name 
could be used to make fun of me ten years from now, I kind of 
regretted using it.
“Really, thank you so much.” She bowed deeply again. Just how 
old was she again—about six? She was well-mannered for one so 
young. “Since you saved me, I have but one selfish request to make 
of you!”
“Sure.” 
“Please give me pen and paper so I can write a letter! Also, 
please tell me where the Adventurers’ Guild is! I appreciate your
help.” Once she finished speaking, Aisha bowed her head again. 
At least she knew how to say “please” when she asked for help. 
She was a clever little girl. Ah, that was right—Paul had mentioned 
57    
something about Lilia giving Aisha an extra-rigorous education, 
hadn’t he?
“That’s all you need? Do you have any money?”
“I have no money!”
“Weren’t you taught that you need money to send letters and to 
buy pen and paper?” It was critical to teach kids the importance of 
money from a young age. I doubted Lilia would skip something that 
important, even if there were some things children shouldn’t be 
taught until they got older.
“My mother taught me that if a girl like me looks up at someone 
with a pleading look in my eyes and says, ‘I want to send a letter to 
my father,’ then I won’t have to spend any money.”
Aha—Lilia, you scoundrel. Were you teaching your daughter to 
use her femininity as a weapon? As I realized that, Aisha’s 
mannerisms started to feel very staged. No, seriously, just what was
Lilia teaching her?
“I’ve been trying to contact my father for a long time, but the 
people in the castle tell me no and won’t let me send any letters!”
I’d already heard that Lilia was being detained. Now I knew that 
they weren’t letting her or Aisha send letters, either. Maybe things 
were pretty serious here. When the Man-God told me I needed to 
“save them,” I’d suspected that this was a situation where Paul was 
being cuckolded.
“Is there anyone else you could ask for help besides your 
father?”
“There isn’t!”
“For instance, someone your mother knows, like a girl who’s a 
little bit older than you and has blue hair? Or, perhaps…a brother of 
yours that should be out there somewhere?” I asked, completely 
nonchalant.
58    
Aisha furrowed her brows. She had a look of dismay on her face, 
but why? “I have a brother, but…”
“But?”
“I can’t ask him for help.”
Why the heck not?! He just saved you a moment ago, didn’t 
he?!
“D-do you mind if I ask what your reasoning is?”
“Reason! Sure! My mother told me about my brother in great 
detail.”
“Okay.”
Aisha continued. “But I couldn’t believe any of it! Like being able 
to use Intermediate-tier magic at three and becoming a King-tier 
Water Magician at five? And then, on top of all that, becoming tutor 
to the daughter of the region’s liege lord? There’s nothing believable 
about that! She’s definitely lying!”
Well, I couldn’t blame her for thinking that. “But maybe if you 
meet him, you’ll see he actually is a good older brother?”
“Not likely!” 
“Wh-why not?”
“My mom had this little box that she treasured, back home. She 
always told me not to touch it, so I asked why. Apparently, it had 
something really important to my brother inside it.”
A little box… Come to think of it, I felt like I’d heard something 
similar from Paul before.
Aisha went on. “One time, when my mother wasn’t around, I 
sneaked a peek. What do you think was it inside of it?!”
“I-I don’t know, what?”
“Panties. Girl’s panties. Judging by the size, a pretty young girl’s 
panties at that. According to my calculations, the girl who owned 
59    
them was probably ten years old. For moment, I thought maybe my 
older brother was actually a sister, but they would have been too big 
for him. So there was only one person they could possibly belong to, 
and that’s my brother’s tutor. He was only four or five and he was 
already saving an older girl’s panties for the future.”
Calculations? Wait, hold on just a second here. This kid was way 
too smart for her age. What the heck? She was just five or six, right? 
“Maybe you’re just miscalculating?” I suggested.
“Nope. I gathered more information from my mother. It seems 
my brother would peek in on that girl while she was bathing, and 
he’d also watch my parents while they were getting it on. My mother 
was trying to cover it up, but I knew there was no mistaking it—my 
brother’s a pervert!”
A pervert! A pervert! A pervert! There’s no mistake, my 
brother’s a pervert! And, just for kicks, once more: A pervert! 
Okay, stop it! I thought. My mental capacity’s already at zero!
“O-oh, okay, so your brother is a pervert. That’s really rough, ha 
ha ha…” I’d brought this on myself, but really, I was in shock. I’d 
never imagined something like this would… Damn. Now I 
understood. This was why the Man-God had told me not to use my 
real name. 
“By the way, Mister Knight, what’s your real name?”
“It’s a secret. On the streets, they call me the Kennel Master of 
Dead End,” I answered, keeping a cool and composed look on my 
face. It was probably best for now if I held off on revealing that I was 
her older brother. 
“Ooh! Mister Kennel Master, is it? How cool! I guess you can use 
summoning magic and stuff, right?”
“Nope,” I said. “All I can do is exert control over two very 
ferocious dogs.”
60    
“Thats amazing!” Aisha had a sparkle in her eyes as she gazed at 
me, almost like a puppy. 
A puppy that was being deceived, that is. That made my heart 
hurt a bit, but if I revealed I was her older brother, she might not be 
willing to listen to me. All I had to do was hide my real identity until I 
could dashingly rescue Lilia. Once I did that, it would greatly improve 
her perception of me.
“All right, I’m going to rescue your mother!”
“Huh?” She stared at me wide-eyed when I made that 
declaration. “B-but—”
“Please just leave it to me!”
And that was how Aisha and I met. She had the absolute worst 
impression of me, but not quite as bad as Norn’s, considering I’d 
punched our father right in front of her eyes. Right now, she thought 
I was a pervert for holding onto Roxy’s panties, but she’d eventually 
come to understand that sometimes people needed something to 
hold onto.
That aside, why would she equate keeping panties with being a 
pervert, anyway? She wasn’t old enough to link underwear to sexual 
desire yet. She wasn’t even old enough to understand what sexual 
arousal was. If someone was teaching weird things to my little sister, 
they wouldn’t go unpunished.
“By the way, Mister Kennel Master.”
“Yes?”
“How come you know my name?!”
We’ll leave out the part where I scrambled for an excuse until I 
finally spotted her name embroidered on the edge of her clothes.
61    
Aisha told me what had happened in the past two years. She 
struggled with the details, resulting in a poor explanation, but I got 
the gist of what she was saying. 
It seemed she and Lilia had been teleported to the Shirone 
Kingdom’s Royal Palace. Their sudden appearance was suspicious, 
and they were both arrested. Lilia had tried to explain, but the 
powers that be decided to keep them both confined to the palace. 
Aisha didn’t understand why, or what would happen next, but she 
did know that for some reason they wouldn’t even let her send a 
letter.
Apparently, they hadn’t done anything bad to Lilia, or at least 
nothing that left visible marks. Who knew what might be going on at 
night while Aisha wasn’t aware of it? Lilia was getting on in years, so 
hopefully the possibility of people going out of their way to violate 
her was low. 
It was strange that they were still being detained two and a half 
years after they were teleported here. Had Lilia really failed to 
correct the misunderstanding in all that time? There had to be some 
other factors I wasn’t aware of.
In the midst of all this, Aisha was trying to send a letter to Paul 
asking for help. She’d gotten lost, and figured that if she followed an 
adventurer, she’d eventually get to the guild. Apparently, that 
adventurer was me. 
Aisha hadn’t mentioned Roxy. Was she really not trying to help 
Lilia? No…it was possible that things were only this bad because Roxy 
was helping from the shadows. Whatever the case, all I could do now 
was wait for Roxy’s reply. The Man-God had told me to send her a 
letter. Now that I had done that, the rest of the puzzle pieces should 
fall into place.
“Ooh, so you came all the way from the Demon Continent, 
huh?” Aisha was anxious to hear more about me.
62    
“Yeah. I was caught up in the Displacement Incident in Fittoa as 
well.”
“And what did you do before that?”
“I was a home tutor. I was teaching magic to a noble’s 
daughter.”
“Oh really? Where at?”
“Roa,” I said.
“That’s the same place as my brother! The two of you might 
have passed each other at some point!”
“Y-yeah. The possibility’s as minute as a grain of salt, but it’s 
there.”
That aside, it seemed Aisha had learned a lot from Lilia. General 
common sense, etiquette, wisdom that would help in her daily life, 
how to be a maid, etc. It seemed suspicious to me that she could 
understand all of that at her age, but at the very least, she knew it 
well enough to be able to explain it to me. Her powers of speech 
were advanced for her age, too. Perhaps she was just pretending to 
act like an adult, but she was still a clever one. Seriously.
Ever since she was young, she’d had the ability to soak up 
whatever she was taught like a sponge. I wondered what she would 
be like as she got older. Could I really maintain my dignity as an older 
brother?
“If you were teaching a noble’s daughter, maybe her family was 
in contact with my brother’s employer. Have you heard anything?”
“N-nope,” I stuttered. “I’m afraid I have no knowledge of him.”
“Oh, All right. I was hoping to hear what your impressions were 
of my brother.”
“Uhhhhh, the only thing I ever heard was that the Young Miss at 
the Liege Lord’s manor was very violent and impossible to manage.” 
63    
Much as I was tempted to drop some more information, Aisha was 
eventually going to discover I was her brother. I didn’t want her 
realizing that I’d deliberately talked about myself while pretending to 
be someone else. 
She asked me various things about the Demon Continent, and I 
answered in detail. I’d been worried I wouldn’t know what to talk 
about with a child this young, but Aisha was so smart that we never 
ran out of topics. Strangely enough, I found myself genuinely 
enjoying what was basically my first real conversation with my little 
sister.
A few hours later, perhaps exhausted, Aisha fell asleep. Eris and 
Ruijerd returned after the sun had set, looking weary. Apparently, 
they’d gone all the way to the slums to gather information, and a lot 
had happened, including a scuffle. 
They’d gotten in a fight yet again? They looked apologetic, but 
this was nothing new, and I wasn’t going to ask for details. Everyone 
messed up sometimes, even me. As long as we had each other’s 
backs, it was fine.
I told them how I’d met Aisha, how Lilia was locked away in the 
castle, and how a lot of things about the situation seemed awfully 
suspicious. While I was at it, I told them I was concealing my name 
from her, too. I impressed upon them the importance of keeping my 
real identity a secret.
“Why are you being so evasive about this?” Eris asked.
“Apparently someone has fed her some misguided information 
about me. I want to show her my good side so I can correct her 
perceptions of me.”
“Hmm. Well, I think you’re cool just the way you are.”
“Eris…” I tried to give her a grin that read thanks for saying such 
sweet things about me, but when I did, Eris took a step back.
64    
“Ugh…why do you get that creepy grin on your face when I 
compliment you?!”
Apparently, my trademark look was a creepy one. That was a bit 
of a shock. Someone please give me a new face…
“Anyway, if that’s what’s going on, then let’s attack the castle!” 
Eris exclaimed, totally ready and willing to throw down.
“It’s been a while since I stormed a castle.” Even Ruijerd was 
hefting his spear as if raring to go.
I hurried to cool their jets. “No, no. Let’s just wait for a reply to 
my letter, for now.” 
Eris looked unenthused at my words. As usual, she just wanted 
to go wild. It certainly would have been simpler to dispense with 
subtlety and launch an attack on the castle, but that might land Roxy 
in trouble, and I wanted to be able to look her in the eye when we 
met. First, we needed to know exactly what was going on. It 
definitely wasn’t just because I wanted to see Roxy, just so you 
know.
With that, the day came to a close.
   
The next day, a knight came to the inn just as the clock was 
about to strike noon. The armor they wore was similar in style to 
that worn by Aisha’s would-be kidnappers, albeit of higher quality. I 
had the others wait in the room while I went down to the lobby by 
myself to deal with them.
“You are Lord Rudeus?”
“Yes.”
65    
“I am part of the Seventh Prince’s imperial guard. My name is 
Ginger York.”
I wondered why a member of the imperial guard was here. Then 
again, Roxy was tutoring a prince. “A pleasure to make your 
acquaintance. I’m Rudeus Greyrat.”
The knight was a woman, and had come alone. She watched me 
without a flicker of emotion as she gave a knightly introduction and 
bowed. I returned it with a nobleman-style bow. I wasn’t actually 
sure what the appropriate greeting was, but as long as I conveyed my 
sincerity, that was enough.
“Lady Roxy bids you come see her. Please accompany me to the 
royal palace.”
She mentioned nothing about the events that transpired the day 
before. I hadn’t hidden my face during the dust-up, but it seemed I 
hadn’t been identified.
I hesitated. What was I supposed to do with Aisha? If I took her 
with me, they would know I was the one who’d attacked those 
soldiers with my stone cannon. I was just going to have to leave her 
behind. I could apologize to the soldiers once I had Roxy to help. 
With that decided, I told Aisha not to leave the room under any 
circumstance and entrusted her protection to Ruijerd and Eris. Since 
I was going to meet Roxy, I double-checked my appearance before I 
left. My hair was combed, and I was in my usual robes. Oh, right, I 
thought. I should get her a box of sweets. I wondered what I should 
buy, since I hadn’t seen her in such a long time.
It was then I happened to spot the ultra-unpopular Ruijerd 
figurine at the bottom of my tool bag. I recalled that in one of her 
letters, she’d talked about seeing a figurine of herself. It might be 
interesting to show her this one and tell her that I’d been the creator 
behind that one, too.
“You’re being awfully thorough about this,” Eris commented.
66    
“It’s been a while since I last saw my master.”
“…You’re going to formally introduce me to her, right?”
“Yeah, of course. I’ll make sure to do that once everything is 
settled.” I finished the last of my preparations.
“Are you sure you’re fine by yourself?” Ruijerd asked in a 
worried tone. I often ran into trouble when I was left on my own, so I 
understood his concern. 
“No problem. If anything comes up, I’ll fly right back here.” That 
was just a figure of speech, of course. I was never going to take such 
drastic action that I broke both of my legs again.
“Mister Kennel Master…” Aisha said.
“Don’t worry. Just leave this to me.” She looked anxious, so I 
patted her on the head. She drew her lips into a line and nodded. 
That’s a good girl, I thought.
Led by the knight Ginger, I started toward the royal palace. We 
moved quickly along the edge of a main road, bustling with carriages 
going to and fro. The road had so many twists and turns and 
sometimes was so narrow that carriages couldn’t freely pass by one 
another. I assumed this was a countermeasure in case of an enemy 
attack. I’d heard of a town in the Mino region back in Japan that had 
streets like this.
Ginger seemed quite taciturn, so I didn’t speak unless necessary. 
If I asked her a question, however, she would respond. She was 
always polite.
“Okay, up next is this one!” An energetic voice boomed through 
the air. I turned my head in its direction. “She used to be a knight 
from the country of Washawa. This is a battle-ready slave! She’s a bit 
feisty, but she’s skilled! Three gold coins!”
67    
A slave market occupied an area facing the main road. There, on 
a tall platform, was a line of slaves. There were three humans and 
one beastfolk with rabbit ears. Two of them were men and two were 
women. All of them had their upper bodies exposed. Even from this 
distance, I could see their skin shining. It was probably oiled to make 
them look more attractive.
I was sure the beastfolk had been taken from the Great Forest. I 
had no means or even an obligation to help them, but I did furrow 
my brow. I squinted at the Washawa woman’s bosom and felt my 
lower half react. I'd thought it strange I hadn't reacted to Aisha, but 
it seemed my little friend down there was still serving active duty.
I could hear the merchant beside the slaves explaining various 
things about them, but I couldn’t make out the particulars. They 
were probably talking about each slave’s selling points, such as their 
abilities and country of origin. After a few moments, the voices from 
the crowd grew louder. It was an auction.
If Lilia and Aisha had been unlucky, they might have ended up 
alongside those slaves. Their current circumstances didn’t seem all 
that bad by comparison—not that I could say that for certain yet.
I realized Ginger was looking at the slave market with a wrinkle 
in her brow. Her duty was to maintain public order in the country. 
Perhaps seeing people doing such unscrupulous business out in the 
open bothered her.
“I thought the slave market was further inside,” I said, by way of 
making conversation. The slave markets we’d seen had mostly been 
nestled further back within their cities. Slavery wasn’t seen as a bad 
thing in and of itself in this world, but this was the first time I’d ever 
seen slaves sold this openly on a main street.
“Indeed. These types of auctions are always conducted further 
within the city.”
68    
“Then I suppose today must be some kind of event or 
something?”
“No. Yesterday, some adventurers apparently got into a fight in 
the area where the slave markets usually are. Since that location can 
no longer be used, they’ve temporarily relocated here.”
A fight at the slave market, huh? Eris and Ruijerd had said they’d 
been involved in a fight. I had a feeling the two things were 
connected, but it would only cause trouble if I brought it up.
“Pardon me,” Ginger said as she suddenly grabbed me under 
the arms and lifted me up. “Please watch the proceedings from 
here.”
“Oh, thank you.”
She was giving me a better vantage point to see what was going 
on. She sure was perceptive. You definitely couldn’t call her a beauty, 
but with her powers of observation, I was sure she’d find a nice 
husband someday.
“Lady Roxy would also hop around trying to get a look whenever 
there was a crowd.”
“Really?”
“Yes. Although she always looked conflicted when I lifted her up 
like this.”
I tried to picture it—Roxy hopping up and down while 
complaining, “I can’t really see.” Then I pictured Ginger, with her 
good intentions, unable to just stand by and watch. Then finally Roxy 
again, looking disheartened as she’d say, “Please put me down.”
“You’ve held her up before like this before?” I asked.
“Yes, and she got mad and told me to put her down 
immediately.”
I knew it. 
“Where did you grab her?”
69    
“Where? The same way I did with you just now.” She’d reached 
under my arms when she’d lifted me up just a moment ago.
“What was it like?”
“It was just like I said,” Ginger repeated. “She looked conflicted 
and told me to put her down immediately.”
What I wanted to know was what her skin felt like, but oh well.
“Please put me down,” I said. “Let’s hurry on.” There wasn’t 
anything particularly interesting happening. All I could see were the 
slaves about to be sold standing in an iron cage. 
We turned back toward the palace and hastened our pace. 
“What’s my teacher doing at the royal palace?” I asked, thinking 
I’d found something we had in common to talk about.
“Usually she’s teaching the prince, but when she’s not busy, she 
joins the soldiers for training.”
I seemed to recall Roxy had mentioned something along those 
lines in the letter she sent me when I was in Roa. “Ah yes, I heard 
how you conducted training under the premise that your opponent 
was a magician?”
According to Roxy’s letter, the soldiers were training to deflect 
magic that she would throw at them while they were engaged in 
melee combat against one another. The principle was that learning 
to deflect magic that came at you suddenly during training would 
help you escape death when you actually faced such circumstances 
on the battlefield.
“That’s correct. We are all Intermediate-tier Water God Style 
swordfighters already, but thanks to Lady Roxy, we can now deflect 
magic when it’s suddenly thrown at us, too.”
So that was why the knight from yesterday was able to deflect 
my stone cannon. It’d been a shock to see a no-name soldier defend 
70    
themselves against my attack, but it made sense now that I knew it 
was thanks to Roxy’s teachings.
We continued talking about Roxy for a little while after that. We 
talked about how it warmed the soldiers’ hearts when they saw 
Roxy’s face go pale after she burned a rug in the middle of her magic 
lesson. Then we talked about how her face turned pale again when a 
meal included bell peppers, and how she swallowed them whole 
without chewing once.
“I’ve heard about you as well, Lord Rudeus,” Ginger said.
“Yeah? Wh-what did she say about me?”
“She told us that from a young age, you were a genius who 
could cast magic without the use of incantations.”
“My teacher said that?” I asked.
“Lady Roxy bragged often about you. She said that she honestly 
felt like she wasn’t even qualified to teach someone of your caliber.”
“Heh heh,” I chuckled. “That’s an exaggeration.”
We eventually reached the castle as we talked. It was quite a 
large one, though not as big as the Kishirisu Castle in Rikarisu or the 
White Palace in Millishion. It was about the same size as the one Eris 
and her family lived in. In other words, the country was about the 
size of a single region in the Asura Kingdom. Way to go Asura 
Kingdom, you sure don’t let a man down!
“…”
Ginger gave a small bow to the guard at the gate. In response, 
he snapped stiffly to attention. “Thank you for your dedicated 
service!”
“Come this way.” I started heading straight ahead, but Ginger 
guided me aside. We circled the castle and went through what 
looked like a back door. “My apologies for this. Only nobles are 
allowed through the front entrance.”
71    
“I understand.”
We came into what resembled a guardroom. There were two 
long desks with numerous soldiers sitting at them, amusing 
themselves with what looked like a card game. The second they saw 
Ginger, they immediately left their seats and stood at attention.
“Thank you for your dedicated service!”
Ginger again bowed slightly before heading deeper inside. I 
watched the men out of the corner of my eye as I followed behind 
her.
“Miss Ginger, are you someone important?”
“Among the knights, I rank about twelfth.”
Twelfth? It was hard for me to tell whether that was a high or 
low ranking. If it included all the hundreds of knights within this 
country, then it probably wasn’t low.
“This way.” Ginger led us way deeper and deeper into the 
palace. Her steps grew increasingly cautious as she went. She never 
climbed any stairs, but simply led me down one final hall and 
stopped outside a door deep within the core of the castle.
This must be Roxy’s room, I thought. It was located in an awfully 
deserted area of the palace, but that somehow seemed appropriate 
for her.
Ginger looked at what I had with me and held out her hand. 
“Excuse me, please hand over your staff and other belongings.”
“Oh, sure.” How kind of her to even go so far as to act like a 
doorman.
Ginger took my things and then pounded her fist against the 
door. “It’s Ginger. I brought Lord Rudeus with me.”
“Enter.” It was a man’s voice that responded.
72    
Before I could process the doubt I felt at that, Ginger 
immediately opened the door and motioned me inside. Obediently, I 
went in.
“Oho…so this is Rudeus, huh?”
Seated before me, looking self-important, was a boy. He looked 
like a small barrel as he arrogantly reclined in his chair. Not just in 
terms of height; his arms and legs looked short, too. Almost like what 
you’d get if you combined a hafling and a dwarf. The only thing 
conspicuously large about him was his head, which was adult-sized. 
His face resembled that of an otaku, giving me a sense that the two 
of us were brethren. It wasn’t an attractive face, though.
Standing at the boy’s side were two maids. One of them looked 
familiar and the other didn’t. We’ll call the latter of the two Maid A. 
She seemed to be in her late twenties and was fairly normal-looking. 
As for Maid B, her face looked exactly like Lilia’s. Actually, no…that 
was Lilia. Five years had passed, so she looked a bit older than I 
remembered. That was no surprise, given she was getting on in years
on top of having been through the stress of the Displacement 
Incident.
“Mrgh?!”
Lilia was in a chair. There were ropes tied around her and her 
mouth was gagged. I didn’t see Roxy anywhere.
“Huh? What the heck is this…?” Confused, I looked around. I 
thought Roxy was going to be here; that she was going to explain 
what was going on.
“Drop him.” 
At the sound of the boy’s voice, the floor beneath me vanished.
   
73    
By the time I realized where I was, I found myself trapped within 
a magic circle. The moment the boy gave the signal, the ground 
beneath my feet fell away and I dropped through a hole in the floor. 
It took me several seconds to realize what had happened. I was in a 
small room now, about six tatami mats wide. There was a magic 
circle drawn on the floor, faint light radiating from it.
I immediately tried to use an earth lance to lift me back up to 
the room above.
“…Huh?”
But the magic never happened. I tried again, channeling a 
greater amount of mana into my feet in order to conjure an earthen 
pillar, but nothing happened. That was strange. I could definitely feel 
the mana leaving my body. This was probably the work of the magic 
circle that surrounded me.
“A barrier, huh…?”
I reached out to the edge of the circle and found myself 
touching what felt like a wall. I tried punching it, but it didn’t even 
shake. I wasn’t getting out of here. 
Still, I didn’t feel a sense of panic. Perhaps my mind didn’t yet 
fully grasp the situation I was in.
“Hahaha! It’s futile! Futile, I say! That’s a King-tier barrier that I 
had created so I could trap Roxy! Someone like you has no hope of 
breaking free of it!” The rotund boy from a moment ago came 
waddling down the steps in the corner of the room. He stood in front 
of me, a great big grin stretched across his face as he triumphantly 
leaned back.
“And you are?” I asked.
“My name is Pax. Pax Shirone!”
Pax? Oh right, the Seventh Prince. What was he planning to do 
by trapping Roxy in a barrier where she couldn’t use her magic? 
74    
Wait—in her letter, Roxy had described him as being similar to me. I 
was a gentleman. So it only stood to reason that he was going to do 
something very gentlemanly. A gentlemanly act of violence.
“Heh heh…I like that look on your face, Rudeus Greyrat.” He 
chortled when he saw my frustration.
I put on a poker face and took a deep breath. Calm down, I told 
myself, just calm down.
“So I’ve fallen into a trap? I understand. I’ll apologize formally 
for attacking those soldiers yesterday. But before that, please call 
Roxy here. I used to be her pupil. She can confirm my identity. Then I 
can call my lawyer and we can have a proper trial—”
“Roxy’s not here.”
Roxy wasn’t there.
“What…?” I was even more shocked by his words than I thought 
I would be. Roxy wasn’t here. That meant God wasn’t here. There 
was no God. 
No, that couldn’t be possible. Did not the great mathematician 
Euler claim that God existed? Did he not receive an order from 
Catherine the Great and magnificently offer up proof that God was 
real? God did exist. I would do the same and prove that God existed 
myself.
“No. God is here.”
“What? God?” Pax had a dumbfounded look on his face.
That’s right, God. Make no mistake—if God wasn’t here, there 
would be a holy war. Bring it on! 
“Hm, so you’re praying to God now? That’s the correct decision, 
though it’s already too late for you.”
“That’s true.” I’d calmed down by now, so it was time to 
dispense with the jokes. “So judging by what you just said a moment 
ago, Roxy isn’t in this country anymore?”
75    
“Correct! You’re going to be the bait that lures her back here.”
“If you mean she’s going to swallow me up, then that’s been my 
lifelong dream,” I responded off-handedly, trying to think. Roxy 
wasn’t in this country, but this person wanted to get his hands on 
her. Why? Was he the reason she ran away?
Just as I thought that, Pax launched his next words at me. “I was 
surprised when I read your letter. I never thought Roxy’s lover would 
try coming to this country!”
“What?! Roxy has a lover?!” Seriously?! I never wrote anything 
like that in my letter, though!”
“Hm? You mean you’re not?” Pax asked.
“Don’t be ridiculous! That’s unthinkable! I’m an unworthy 
apprentice; there’s no way such a relationship would develop 
between us!” I shook my head violently.
I was actually incredibly happy he’d made that assumption. 
Happy enough to make me want to wiggle with glee. I wanted to 
wiggle around like a certain rare reindeer. I wanted to wiggle around 
like a certain person living within a metal monster. But I forcefully 
restrained myself.
“Hmm…well, even if you’re not her lover, she’ll still come for her 
pupil.”
“Will she really?” I asked.
“She will. Lilia may have been too weak to use as bait, but for 
you, the pupil whose praises she wouldn’t stop singing, she’ll 
definitely come! Then when she does, it’ll be the end of her as a 
woman. She’ll live the rest of her life as my sex slave! I’ll make her 
give birth to five of my heirs!” 
“Excuse me, can I ask just one thing?”
76    
“What? Ah yes. I’ll be sure to rape her the first time right before 
your eyes! Then I’ll do it a second time after I cut off your head and 
see her face filled with despair!”
Boy, this kid had some wild delusions.
“Prior to coming here,” I said, “I couldn’t find any information 
about Lilia, so…how is Roxy going to know that I’ve been taken 
captive?”
Pax froze. “Hm…well she’s incredibly capable, I’m sure she’ll 
catch wind of it somewhere!”
Uh-huh. So it’d be fine because Roxy was capable. Perhaps she’d 
be able to find information that I hadn’t been able to, but the odds 
seemed unlikely.
“But don’t you think it would be better to let that information 
out into the world?” Not that I wanted to see Roxy get raped, but if 
he did that, word might get to Paul’s ears.
“Hmph, I’m not going to fall for that! You’re under the 
patronage of one of Asura’s high-ranking nobles, aren’t you?! I’d be 
making enemies of the Boreas family if they knew that I was holding 
you or Lilia in captivity, wouldn’t I?”
“You would…?” Hmm. Something seemed strange here. Well, 
old man Sauros might try to help if he heard I’d been taken captive. 
But what did that have to do with Lilia?
“Lilia also tried sending letters numerous times! As if I would 
allow her to call for help!”
Why in the world was he not letting her write for help if the 
whole point was reeling Roxy in?
Ahh, I get it, I thought. He’s a moron.
“Besides,” he added, “I can just hand that information straight 
to her!”
“You can?” I asked, doubtful.
77    
“I’ve been searching for her for the past two years, but I haven’t 
found her yet! Still, one day I will! She stands out wherever she 
goes!”
Just because she stood out didn’t mean he’d ever find her. She’d 
written in her letters that he was similar to me. That he had talent. 
Did that just mean her impression of me was this bad?
“Heh heh. It looks like you’ve given up. I don’t care if you are a 
magician who can cast spells without voicing them—you stand no 
chance against me!”
There was no way I was going to lose to this guy! I glared at him.
“Ooh, I like the look in your eyes. Makes me shiver. I hope you’ll 
keep that look until the very end. Ahh, I’m looking forward to it so 
much. Roxy, don’t keep me waiting…” He sounded like a little boy 
pining for attention as he mounted the stairs, disappearing through 
the hole in the ceiling.
There’s no way in hell she’s coming, I thought to myself.
“Hey, who said you could remove Lilia’s gag?”
“I’m sorry, but she seemed like she had something to say.”
“That’s not your decision to make!”
“Please, Your Highness. I don’t care what you do to me, but 
please spare Lord Rudeus!”
“Shut up, I don’t need anything from an old hag like you!”
“Aah!”
I heard a cry from the stairs above, accompanied by a dry 
slapping sound. Did he just slap Lilia?
“Anyway, have you still not found Aisha?!”
“Your Highness, we’re still searching for her!”
78    
“Grr. What does the man who kidnapped her look like?!” I could 
hear the irritation in Pax’s voice. Apparently, they were talking about 
what happened yesterday.
This wasn’t good. I hadn’t concealed my face, so I was sure 
they’d figure out it was me immediately. I’d put the location of the 
inn in my letter, too. But oh well, so what if they found me out? 
Ruijerd and Eris were at the inn. As long as Ruijerd was there, I was 
sure he’d take care of things. Eris’ offensive skills had established 
their own reputation, too.
“According to the report, he called himself the Knight of the 
Shadow Moon. He’s a huge, brawny man who laughs loudly as he 
jumps from roof to roof like a pervert.”
“If it’s someone who stands out that much, why haven’t you 
caught him yet?! Dammit, you’re all so useless!”
“Yes, sir! My apologies!”
Hey, wait a minute! Excuse me, Mister Soldier! Please report the 
facts properly! Just what part of my body was brawny and muscular?
Wait, no—perhaps the inaccurate report had been given out of 
kindness. Maybe they were trying to help Aisha escape. They didn’t 
seem like bad people when I met them, after all. Okay, good job, 
Mister Soldier!
“According to the report, we did tear up the letter she wrote.”
“And she can rewrite that letter as many times as she wants!”
“A high-ranking noble isn’t going to take action just because of a 
child’s letter. Shouldn’t we just forget about her?”
“No, no, no! Search for her! Don’t you care what happens to 
your family?”
“…I’ll dispatch a search party immediately!”
Then came the sound of frantic footsteps. Judging by the 
conversation, did that mean Ginger’s family had been taken hostage?
79    
“Hmph. Throw Lilia in her usual chambers!”
“Yes, sir!”
“Lord Rudeus! I swear I’ll save you!”
“Shut up! As if I’d allow you to do that!”
“Aah!”
“Hmph. You knew Roxy too, didn’t you? I’ll have you beheaded 
in front of that impudent brat as well!”
Smack! I heard another dry slapping sound, followed by 
something being dragged across the floor.
“Rudeus! I’m never going to let you go!”
When I followed the voice and looked up, I saw Pax’s creepy 
face grinning down at me. Then, a lid was slid over the hole above. 
Quiet settled over the room as I was left with only the faint light of 
the magic circle as company.
“Phew…”
I felt somewhat dumbfounded. I should’ve been angry at Lilia 
being hit, but strangely, I didn’t feel rage rising up within me. 
Perhaps it was because the entirety of our interactions prior to that 
had been comical. Or because the Man-God had already told me she 
would be saved. 
Then again, maybe it was because all of this was a product of 
Pax’s feelings for Roxy, as warped as they might have been. I might 
have ended up the same way, had I been cast aside by her. 
No, that wasn’t it. It was because he did resemble me—the old 
me, before I was reincarnated. That was why I felt confusion rather 
than anger.
“Well then…”
Regardless, I understood the gist of what was going on. Simply 
put, Pax was the one who had captured Lilia. Then he’d detained her, 
80    
using whatever pretext he saw fit, such as claiming she was the spy 
of a foreign power. As he listened to what she had to say, he’d 
somehow come to the conclusion that she was associated with Roxy, 
which was when he devised his plan. He would use Lilia as bait, 
contact Roxy, and lure her back here.
He kept this all secret for fear of the Greyrat family, but really, 
even if the Asura Kingdom found out, Lilia was nothing more than a 
maid. The secrecy—and the fact that they were unable to locate 
Roxy—was why Lilia had been detained for so long.
Lilia was surely trying to send Paul a cry for help, but the prince 
would not allow it. That was why Aisha had escaped the castle in an 
attempt to try to post her letter, only to fail and have her letter 
shredded.
What came afterward was what baffled me. For some reason 
the guards were falsifying reports to aid her escape. Did they just 
hate the prince, or was there another reason involved? It seemed 
like Ginger’s family had been taken hostage, so maybe the other 
soldiers found themselves in a similar situation?
And I’d landed myself perfectly in the middle of their spider 
web. But I did write to Roxy, just as the Man-God had instructed me 
to do. This was probably all part of how things were supposed to end 
up, right? There was no need for me to panic. Right now, I was doing 
exactly as I’d been told.
No…wait.
Had I really done things the way I was supposed to? For 
instance, I told the soldiers I was the Knight of the Shadow Moon. 
According to the Man-God’s advice, as long as I told Aisha I was the 
Kennel Master of Dead End, everything would be fine. But maybe I 
was supposed to use that name with the soldiers as well?
That wasn’t my only potential misstep. The same thing 
happened with the letter. I thought for sure I would be fine as long 
81    
as I didn’t say my name was Rudeus, but if I hadn’t written my name 
on that letter, maybe things wouldn’t have ended up like this? If the 
prince had thought I was just some acquaintance of Roxy’s, perhaps 
things would have proceeded more peacefully?
Crap. Now I really felt like I’d screwed things up.
No, it was fine. It was still fine, right? This was still within 
expectations, right?
I was worried. For the moment, I decided, I would at least try to 
secure an escape route.
82    
Hey there! My name is Rudeus and I used to be a shut-in.
Currently, I’m checking out a free apartment in the Shirone 
Kingdom. There’s no security deposit and no rent. It’s a one-room 
apartment that provides no meals and doesn’t have much in the way 
of natural lighting. There’s no bed provided, and the lack of a toilet 
means you have to resort to the old-fashioned way of pissing your 
pants, so living here for an extended period will no doubt result in 
serious illness. At least it’s free! 
It’s also reassuringly secure in its construction. Please see for 
yourself how durable the barrier is! As long as you stay inside it, 
magic is nullified and you’ll never be able to get out! Even if an Aranked adventurer like me hits it as hard as they can, the barrier 
won’t budge. It doesn’t matter if you’re a masterful escape artist—
there’s no easy way of getting out of this place.
Okay, that’s the second time I’ve used this joke, so enough of 
that.
I can’t get out of here. Someone save me. Ruijerd, hurry up and 
save me! Save meee, Rui! 
I felt like Princess Peach waiting for Mario to come for me.
I spent an entire day after that trying to remove the barrier. 
Since I couldn’t use magic while I was in it, there was basically 
nothing I could do. Mostly my attempts consisted of pounding on a 
wall I couldn’t see, trying to scrub at the circle on the floor, and 
trying to leap up toward the ceiling that was nearly four meters 
above me. I did everything I could, which basically amounted to 
nothing.
83    
If I’d at least had my staff, I might’ve been able to smack the 
ceiling with it. Sadly, I’d given all my things to Ginger before I’d 
entered the room. 
As for magic, I tried numerous spells, but they all fizzled before 
they could do anything. Like a shounen protagonist, I decided that if 
this barrier absorbed mana then I would unleash as much as I could 
and destroy it that way! But it didn’t seem to have any effect. I could 
produce mana, but it didn’t take shape. I couldn’t use my mana to 
trigger a change around me. It seemed like I could, but I couldn’t. It 
was like using a lighter in such strong wind that it blew out every 
time you clicked it. The gas was there, the spark was there, but there 
was no fire. Or maybe it was more like the fire appeared but was 
snuffed out immediately.
He said this was a King-tier magical barrier, right? It was 
incredible.
My impatience grew as I realized that I couldn’t get out of here 
on my own. If the worst came to pass and Roxy actually came to help 
me, falling into Pax’s trap in the process, there was nothing I could 
do to save her. All I would be able to do would be to scream for her 
to leave me behind. If Eris was the one that got caught instead, I 
could do nothing to help her, either. Once again, I’d be screaming for 
them to leave me behind. And what if Pax changed his mind and 
decided that he had me, so he didn’t need other hostages, and tried 
to have Lilia killed? 
I wanted to believe that everything would be okay, but I hadn’t 
followed the Man-God’s advice perfectly. Maybe I was already way 
off track. It was the Man-God we were talking about, though. Maybe 
he foresaw this. But according to what he’d said, only Aisha and Lilia 
would be saved. He hadn’t mentioned anyone else. 
But no…he gave me that advice to earn my trust. It was difficult 
to believe he’d purposefully worded it to be deceptive. Still, even 
84    
then… Negative thoughts kept cutting in and whirling around in my 
head.
Dammit, I thought. I need to hurry up and get out of here.
I wondered how much time had passed. I felt exhausted. It was 
the first time in a long while that I’d used so much mana.
“Phew…maybe I should rest for a bit.”
There was no clock and I couldn’t see the sun, so I had only a 
vague sense of time. My stomach was also empty and had been 
growling for a little while now. Don’t tell me that prince had 
forgotten about my food, too? No, maybe that was the point. Maybe 
he meant to reduce my food intake and whittle me down until I was 
as dainty and brittle as a branch. That way, it would excite him more 
when he showed Roxy what I’d become. Just one meal a day then, 
huh? That would be terribly unpleasant, given that my body was still 
growing.
I couldn’t break out of here through strength alone. Maybe I 
needed to twist this around in my head some more. How did people 
in my previous world escape from prison? They pretended to be sick 
or dead, right? Maybe they would temporarily power down the 
barrier to let a doctor or healer inside. No—it was also possible 
they’d just leave me to die. They already had another hostage, after 
all. If I were a Hollywood star, I could just strike out as the guard 
came by my cell, knock them unconscious and steal their keys. Sadly, 
that wasn’t possible here.
What other methods were left to me? Really, I just needed to 
get out of here. Maybe I could pretend I was willing to pledge my 
loyalty to Pax.
“Truth is, that Roxy’s been gettin’ on my nerves for a long time 
now, boss. Heh heh heh! And actually, I know where her parents are! 
Whatdya think about doin’ it in front of them, eh, boss?”
85    
If I said it like that, he might actually fall for it, right? He did look 
like a moron, after all.
Nah, let’s not. That wasn’t possible, even for me. Roxy. I could 
abandon every last bit of my own pride, but the one thing I couldn’t 
do was say something bad about Roxy.
Thump… Thump…
As I worried over what to do, I suddenly heard something. 
Footsteps. They were growing closer. Probably Pax coming to see 
how I was doing.
Thump…
The footsteps stopped directly above me. Then they cut across 
the room and I could hear them at the top of the stairs.
“Aha, just as Ginger told me.”
The man who glided down the steps was someone I’d never 
seen before. I could tell with one look that he was likely part of the 
royal family, primarily because of how grandiose his clothing looked. 
It was black with gold embroidery and you could tell at once that it 
was expensive. He appeared to be about twenty. His face was similar 
to Pax’s, but oval-shaped, with glasses resting above protruding 
cheekbones, and he was taller and thinner. In other words, he looked 
like your typical book nerd anime character with opaque glasses.
“I am the Shirone Kingdom’s Third Prince, Zanoba Shirone,” he 
said with a rigid look.
Third Prince? So, that meant he was Pax’s older brother. “A 
pleasure to make your acquaintance,” I replied. “I’m Rudeus 
Greyrat.”
“Hm.”
“And what brings you here today?”
“Hm.” He nodded in an exaggerated way, and hoisted a bag in 
his hands. A bag I’d seen before. No wait—that was my bag! He left it 
86    
on the ground and carefully extracted something from within. It was 
a figurine of a man wielding a spear—a Ruijerd figurine.
“Where did you get this demon figurine?” he asked, as he 
placed it just outside the barrier. “Tell me. I heard from Ginger that 
you brought it here with you.” His tone was very demanding.
A demon figurine. I’d brought it with me without much thought, 
but perhaps carrying a demon figurine was like carrying a false god’s 
idol around these parts. Roxy’s figurine had no distinguishable 
demonic characteristics, but Ruijerd’s was instantly identifiable 
because of the jewel on his forehead.
How was I supposed to answer this one? At the very least, I was 
sure I shouldn’t say I was the one who made it.
“I just happened to pick it up when I was traveling on the 
Demon Continent.”
“Aha! I knew it must have been a demon that made this! All 
right, where exactly did you acquire this? What did the person selling 
it look like? Do you know who made this?!”
Boy, he was really invested in this. His eyes were gleaming.
“Wh-who knows?” I said. “I just saw it and liked it, so I decided 
to buy it. I don’t know any specifics about—”
“Whaat?!” A dangerous glint of light reflected off his glasses. 
There was something seriously intimidating about him. He had the 
eyes of a person who had killed before.
“Oh yeah! The merchant told me something when he sold it to 
me. He said that if you have that figurine in your possession, you’ll be 
safe even if a Superd attacks you. Just show them that figurine and 
chant at them ‘Ruijerd loves children,’ ‘Ruijerd loves children,’ and 
suddenly the Superd will act like you’re old friends from ten years 
ago. They’ll sling their arm around you and say, ‘Hey bro!’ And stuff 
like that.”
87    
“Oho, oho! Yes, that’s it! What else?! What else did they say?!”
“Uhh, you’ll be blessed with perfect health and children. A-also, 
you’ll get really good at swordplay?”
“No, no, not that! What you’re telling me is that someone who 
is deeply involved with the Superd tribe created this, yes?!”
I wasn’t sure those two things were related. The only Superd I 
knew was Ruijerd. But as for being deeply involved, maybe? Many in 
this world didn’t want anything to do with the Superd tribe, so in 
comparison, yes, I was deeply involved.
“Hmm, it seems like there’s a strong possibility this was made by 
the same person.” Zanoba hummed thoughtfully to himself as he 
spun the figurine in his hand. Finally, he thumped it to the ground 
and reached back into the bag. The only other thing left inside should 
have been an emergency change of clothes.
“Then tell me, do you recognize this?”
What he produced from the bag this time was a Roxy figurine. 
He put it on the floor, then plunked himself down behind it.
88    
89    
“This demon figurine was discovered five years ago in the 
markets.” He put his hand on his chin and gazed affectionately at the 
figurine.
When I’d tried to use the Ruijerd figure to proselytize, I found 
out that demon figurines were forbidden due to the influence of the 
Millis religious organization. I assumed Zanoba was looking to 
condemn the person who’d created them, although he didn’t seem 
very angry.
“It was my brother who discovered this one. When he saw it 
looked like Roxy, our court magician at the time, he purchased it 
directly from the merchant in the market.”
“Your court magician ‘at the time’?” I clarified, noting the past 
tense.
“Hm? Yes. It seems you’re unaware, but Roxy Migurdia has 
already left this country. She ran after being unable to tolerate my 
brother’s unwanted sexual advances.”
No, actually, I had already heard about that from Pax. But it 
made sense that she left after being sexually harassed.
“How exactly did your brother try getting friendly with her?”
“‘Getting friendly’…? He stole her underwear and peeked at her 
while she was bathing.”
Seriously? How awful. People like that needed to be severely 
punished. Such as having their computer smashed in with a bat. He 
should be forced to live under the same roof as a young miss with a 
killer punch that could knock your lights out in one blow. He should 
be stripped naked, thrown in a cell, and have cold water tossed on 
him. Shoot, I’d even be willing to conjure up an earth lance and slam 
it right into his ass. One thick and shaped like a traffic cone.
Anyway, seriously. Did he honestly think it was okay to steal 
Roxy’s panties and all that? No, it was unacceptable. It was 
90    
unforgivable. It didn’t matter that he was a prince—he should still 
know right from wrong. It was no wonder she left.
Wait. By that logic, could it be…that Roxy had quit being my 
tutor because of the things I did?
“More importantly, on the issue of these figurines…” Zanoba 
said, patting the shoulder of the Roxy statuette.
That’s right—we were best leaving this depressing conversation 
behind us. I nodded, my face solemn.
“I have a weakness for figurines. I collect them from all over the 
world,” he started, as a sort of preamble. “This is the only one in my 
possession whose maker and origins I don’t know. I know it was 
made of rock and chiseled down, but it’s harder and heavier than the 
stonework used by the dwarves. No one in the world has the 
technique to chisel a sculpture this elaborate from such hard rock. 
For example…look here, at the staff. Even for the most adept dwarf, 
carving something so precisely in stone is incredibly difficult.” He 
pointed to the weapon the figurine was holding as he spoke.
Complex pieces like the staff were easy to break. A lot of trial 
and error went into trying to compensate for that flaw. As a reward 
for my efforts, I managed to create something very tough and 
durable. I used the same material to make the spear on Ruijerd’s 
figurine. It required a fair amount of mana, concentration, and time 
to achieve—more specifically, an entire day just for a centimeter of 
work. I’d dedicated a lot to perfecting my technique, so I was happy 
to hear it being praised.
“Something this incredible was being sold for a mere five Asura 
gold coins. I would have paid one hundred coins for this. It bothers 
me that those living on the streets are so unrefined and boorish they 
can’t appreciate its value. Granted, the price could be cheap 
specifically because it’s a figurine of a demon. If one of the Millis 
faith’s temple knights knew you were in possession of this, you’d be 
91    
put on trial for heresy, even if you were a prince of Shirone. Then 
they would execute you for being a Demon God worshipper. There 
could be a number of reasons why this is being sold at such a low 
price.” Zanoba put a hand to his forehead and shrugged as if 
exasperated.
Executed? Well, the temple knights were full of fanatics, 
apparently.
“I’ve searched for the creator of this figurine before. I don’t care 
to get involved with a Demon God worshipper, but still, I want to 
speak to the person who created this. It was then that Lilia suddenly 
appeared at my door. Just one day after Roxy left.”
Hm. So they’d coincidentally just missed each other.
“Lilia was taken by the soldiers, and after things finally settled, 
Pax took possession of her. This was one of the things she had,” 
Zanoba said as he reached into the bag again and produced a small 
box, one I had no recollection of seeing. It was fist-sized. “She carried 
it with her like it was so precious. It struck me as odd. Look at it 
closely.” He opened it so I could see inside.
There was something tucked into the folds of a soft-looking 
fabric, which he gently pulled away. Inside was a pendant carved of 
wood. I felt like I’d seen that sort of wood somewhere before. It was 
hand-carved, though you could tell it wasn’t made by practiced 
hands.
“The pendant?”
“Hm, the pendant is irrelevant.” He pinched it between his 
fingers and placed it on top of the bag. His movements were so 
graceful. Still, what did he mean by “irrelevant”? 
That was when I recognized the cloth that had been wrapped 
around the pendant.
“Now then, about these panties…” Zanoba pinched the fabric 
between his fingers and stretched it out. It was white and shaped like 
92    
a home plate. I knew those belonged to God (Roxy) without a 
shadow of a doubt.
Those panties were the object of my worship.
“Lilia said she tried to send these to you for your tenth 
birthday.”
So the pendant was just camouflage. Zanoba had already 
deduced that the real treasure was the cloth wrapped around them. 
Perhaps Lilia had tried to send them as-is before, but realized it 
would look bizarre to send me underwear for my birthday, so she 
added the pendant.
Unfortunately, my object of worship (Roxy’s panties) had been 
washed. Roxy’s extra virgin olive oil had been cleaned away, so 
they’d already lost their divinity. God was no longer nestled in that 
pair of underwear. In her place resided Lilia’s sincerity.
“S-so what about the panties?” I asked, hiding the tremor in my 
voice.
Zanoba hummed and nodded, leaning forward onto all fours. 
“Before we talk about the panties, let me explain this figurine to 
you.” And so, he began to speak. The words came like a flood, 
unending, and he had a look of ecstasy on his face the entire time.
“First, look at it from the front. A glance will tell you that it’s just 
a normal magician wielding a staff. Look at the way the fabric 
wrinkles. The way she steps out with one leg, her staff clutched 
tightly in her hand and thrust out. The moment is captured so vividly. 
Then look at the hem and sleeves of her robe, her wrists and ankles! 
The slight exposure of her skin. It’s ever so slight, and yet it somehow 
has a sense of eroticism to it. It’s from what little you can see that 
you realize this girl is thin, that her lithe figure is hidden within the 
depths of these robes. Her clothing is so loose around her, but you 
can tell!”
93    
“Next, let’s look at her from behind. Normally, you can’t see the 
outline of the body in baggy clothing. But by putting the leg in front, 
the clothing is pulled tight so you can see just the slightest outline of 
her butt. A small butt. You probably wouldn’t find it sexy at all if you 
saw it in real life. But the way it stands out in this baggy robe is 
exactly what makes it sexy! It’s the way her butt is presented that 
makes you want to see more. And actually, you can do just that. If 
you unclasp the part that keeps the robe on here, you can see her 
innocent form clad in underwear. Not only that, but this girl isn’t 
wearing a bra, either. A good decision for someone like Roxy, since 
she has such a small chest.
“Now if you turn the figurine back around, you see that her left 
arm is covering her breasts. Strange, you’d think, because her left 
hand was grasping her staff just a moment ago. But if you look at the 
robe you just pulled off, you realize the left hand was attached to it. 
That’s right. This figure has three arms. One extra for when the robe 
is attached and another for when you reduce her to her underwear. 
With this little gimmick, it’s like you have two figures in one. Truly 
genius. Normally, constructing a figure with removable clothing 
forces the pose to be static, but hiding an extra limb within her 
clothes gives a sense of freedom to her pose.
“That’s not the only thing. Next, let’s look at her from the side. 
When she wears her robe, the line of her back is curved and her leg 
is stretched out front. But when you take it off, for some reason 
she’s slumped forward, almost as if she’s trying to hide her chest, her 
body. Now that you’ve seen that, look at her face. When she had her 
robe on, she looked dignified. Now, she looks like she’s desperate to 
hide how shy she is, right?
“The person who made this understood that the impression 
given by the figurine would change with the clothes. That’s why they 
knew they could leave the expression the same. This is an object of 
the most exquisite quality. Certainly, there are aspects of it that 
94    
couldn’t hope to compare to the nuanced skill of the dwarves. You 
might call it amateur at best. And yet, this figurine itself is in a realm 
far beyond what those crude dwarves could hope to achieve!”
I didn’t miss a single word he said. Most people would’ve been 
flabbergasted by his spiel, but I was the creator of that figurine. I 
digested everything he said and was quite satisfied with his review in 
the end. That was a given, of course; never before had I heard 
someone talk so animatedly about something I’d made. Of course, 
he was exactly right. I’d used every skill I had at the time to create 
that figurine. Even though it was still the work of an amateur, anyone 
who looked closely would realize its potential. I was happy that he’d 
spotted even the minute details I’d labored to perfect. There was just 
one thing missing. It was the reason why I’d had her hide her breasts 
with her hand.
“Huh?” I voiced my realization. “The mole under her armpit is 
gone.”
“Hm?” Zanoba responded, turning the Roxy figure over again. 
“Aah, the dark spot under her arm? I thought it lowered the beauty 
of the figure, so I shaved it off,” he said off-handedly.
I froze at his words. My eyes widened and my body stilled. “Yyou shaved it off?”
“Yes, and the fact that you know about that means that you do
know something about this figurine, don’t you?”
I ignored him. “Turn the figurine around a little.”
“Answer my question before I do.”
“I said turn it,” I barked coldly, surprising myself.
Zanoba let out a whine and shrank back, but he did as I said and 
spun the statue around.
95    
“Stop it there. Now look at it again.” I made him stop and look at 
the point on the figurine where you could just barely see where the 
mole had been. “Look where the hand is positioned.”
“What are you talking about?”
“Don’t ask, just look.”
I could tell Zanoba was annoyed with the harsh tones in which I 
spoke. Still, he complied and looked at the figurine. He was quite the 
serious type.
“Can you tell that she’s not quite covering it?”
“…Hm?”
I continued. “Can you tell that her hand doesn’t quite reach it?”
“Ah,” Zanoba said in a quiet voice. Finally, he understood why 
she was hiding her chest with her hand. He understood why, in a 
world where the concept of “eighteen or older” wasn’t a thing, I 
chose not to reveal Roxy’s modest, adorable breasts.
“Do you understand now why she’s hiding her breasts but not 
hiding that mole?”
“No way…it can’t be…!” Zanoba was trembling all over.
That was right. That was the exact reason I’d zeroed in on her 
mole. Since you couldn’t see her nipples, the next thing that stood 
out was her mole, and I had emphasized her embarrassment at not 
being able to hide both. In other words, the sexiest aspect of that 
figurine was the mole itself.
“I-I didn’t…understand at all…and I’ve defiled…this creation…!” 
His eyes went blank and his body started to convulse. Foam was 
spouting from his mouth. Wasn’t this a bit of an exaggerated 
response?
“Well, it’s just a mole. You can add it back on pretty easily. 
Anyway, what about the panties?”
“Th-the panties are… the same as the ones on the figurine…”
96    
My gaze flitted between the fabric in his hands and the 
statuette. The underwear on it was exactly the same as my former 
object of worship. That made sense. I’d used the underwear I was 
most familiar with as a reference when creating the figurine. On a 
related note, Roxy had four other pairs of underwear at the time, the 
details of which were all a bit different. She was quite fashionconscious.
“So that’s what this is about. All right, so what do you want me 
to tell you about the figurine, then?” No use hiding it anymore. If he 
was treating the figurine with this much care, then he probably 
wasn’t going to hand me over to the temple knights.
“Aaaah!” Zanoba’s entire body suddenly fell to the floor, 
slapping against the ground. It shocked me. “So you, my lord, are the 
one who created this figurine!” 
And now he was groveling before me? I had no idea what was 
going on. The only thing I did know was how magnificent Roxy was.
“I would expect no less from a pupil of the Water King Magician 
Roxy! You made this figurine using magic, didn’t you?!”
How dare he use her name without a proper title. That’s Miss
Roxy to you!
“My lord, I look at your creation every day. Every time I see it, I 
discover something new, and my respect for you only grows 
stronger. Please, allow me to call you ‘master’!” He scurried across 
the floor like an insect as he spoke, trying to kiss my shoes, only be 
repelled with a loud cry as he smacked against the barrier instead. 
He looked like one of those obsessed fans vying for the newest 
release on the third day of summer Comiket. 
“Gaaaah! Why is this barrier here?! Who dared to put this 
here?! Master! Please allow me to pay my respects to your godlike 
hands! Pleeeeaaaaseeaaah!”
And that was how I obtained a slightly creepy disciple.
97    
I’d met people like this in my previous life. Most of them were 
people I’d met online—people I couldn’t quite call friends. Now I 
understood—this was the face those people were making behind 
their screens. This must have been what the Man-God foresaw 
happening. I was to be taken inside the castle where I’d meet this 
guy, we’d bond and he’d lend me his power to help me escape. All 
right! The ending was now in sight!
I put on my best Buddha face and said, “My pupil. There should 
be a magical crystal in this room maintaining this barrier. Find it and 
destroy it!”
“Understood, Master! Once I’ve carried that out please, I beg of 
you, impart upon me your knowledge of the figurine craft!”
“You’ll be excommunicated if you don’t carry it out. Never again 
will I permit you to call me ‘master,’” I said.
“Yes, of course!” Zanoba replied energetically. He began to 
search the inside of this room, then the room above, skittering 
across the floor as if he were a cockroach.
An hour passed, and the only thing that Zanoba discovered was 
a letter-sized hole in the ceiling with a removable lid. Apparently, 
that was how Pax intended to toss food down to me. That was all 
well and good, but how was the prince intending to deal with 
excrement and me getting sick from it? Perhaps he intended to toss 
a sleeping agent in here and lower the barrier while I was knocked 
out to deal with it. 
No, let’s be honest, he probably hadn’t given it any thought at
all. Pax was the kind of guy who thought taking care of a pet 
consisted merely of giving it food and nothing else.
At any rate, I could find a way to escape if we removed the lid 
covering the hole. The room had a high ceiling, but I could probably 
climb out if someone threw a rope down. Unfortunately, the heavy 
98    
stone slab that acted as a lid was so firmly planted over the hole it 
was almost like it’d been welded there. Removing it would prove 
difficult. There was apparently another magic circle drawn on top of 
it, too. They seemed to be a set.
“Your highness, is there no one under your command who’s 
knowledgable about barriers?” I asked.
“I don’t have anyone under my command!”
“Really, you don’t? But even Pax had his own imperial guard.”
“I traded the last of them for this Roxy figurine! Ahh, and what a 
wonderful deal it was!”
So this guy was a moron, too. Also, what the heck was wrong 
with this country if you could trade your guards away like that? 
“All right…now I understand.”
“Ooh, you do? Just what I’d expect from you, Master!”
“Yes. It looks like you’ll be excommunicated after all.”
“Whaaaat?!”
My creepy little disciple would be excommunicated with 
unusual swiftness… Actually, no. I had no intention of losing a helper 
I’d been lucky enough to obtain. I amended my statement. “Let’s 
change my earlier requirement. As long as you help me get out of 
here, I’ll make you my pupil once I’m free.”
“Yes! That’s completely fine with me! Just a bit, just wait for a 
bit! I’ll break through the ceiling with my fist!”
“Don’t be irrational.” I hurried to stop Zanoba as he glared at 
the ceiling, his hand curled into a fist. The look on his face seemed 
genuine. His face said he’d keep punching away at the lid until the 
bones in his hand were shattered to pieces.
Zanoba fidgeted for a while before suddenly looking up, as if 
he’d realized something. “Master, just who was it that created this 
barrier?”
99    
“Uhh, judging by our conversation, pretty sure it was the 
Seventh Prince, Pax.”
“Hm, now that you mention it, Ginger did say something along 
those lines…”
“You mean you didn’t hear the specifics?” I asked, just to clarify.
“A bit. I was too busy thinking about figurines.”
“Oh,” I said, “okay then.”
At any rate, it seemed like this prince was in contact with 
Ginger. Ginger must have been making her own moves in the 
background—which meant she had her own issues with Pax. Zanoba 
said he came here because Ginger told him about me. That meant 
that Ginger wanted the two of us to meet. She must have seen the 
Ruijerd figurine and thought we had similar interests. But what was 
her aim in trying to win over an undependable person like Zanoba? 
Zanoba spoke up. “So, Master, that means I just have to do 
something about Pax, right?”
“Hm? Yeah, that would do the trick.”
Zanoba thought for a moment and then spoke in a voice so 
quiet that the excitement he’d exhibited before almost seemed like a 
lie. “Very well. Please be patient for a little while, then.”
“Uhh, before you do anything, please get someone’s input first. 
Like Miss Ginger’s, for instance. Or mine.”
“Ha ha ha! Master, you really are a worrywart! Rest at ease, you 
can leave everything to me.”
“Hey, wait a second! Where are you going? Listen to me! What 
are you planning to do?!”
Zanoba just laughed as he climbed back up the stairs and left.
“Are you kidding me…?” I had the distinct feeling I’d really 
screwed something up. Forcing this prince—who apparently had no 
servants of his own—to make a move felt like the equivalent of 
100    
shoving a stick in a hornet’s nest. A keen sense of foreboding came 
over me.
I should have just asked him to bring me some food instead.
However, as I would soon learn, I was completely mistaken. I 
had totally misread the man known as Zanoba Shirone. Looking back 
on what had transpired, I would come to realize that the course of 
events was probably decided the moment Zanoba found out I was 
the creator of that figurine.
101    
Before I talk about how things resolved themselves, 
there’s one factor I’d like to discuss. There was a child born into this 
world with an abnormality. The word abnormality probably makes 
you think of a physical condition, but most children like this looked 
normal by all accounts. The opposite was in fact true: the only thing 
normal about him was his appearance.
This child possessed a unique ability when he was born. You see, 
there were children who could run abnormally fast, had superhuman 
strength, had enhanced hearing, had a body lighter than a feather or 
were conversely incredibly heavy, could freeze anything they 
touched, could breathe fire, had poison-tipped fingers, could 
teleport short distances, could shoot laser beams from their eyes, 
could nullify any and every poison, could spend an entire day awake 
without feeling tired, or could have sex with hundreds of women at 
the same time without going soft… Such a child, who was possessed 
of superhuman abilities when they were born, was called a Blessed 
Child. If they possessed an ability that wasn’t particularly useful, or 
even unfavorable, then they were deemed a Cursed Child, but we’ll 
leave that aside for now.
Now that we have taken into account the existence of Blessed 
Children, let’s talk about the Shirone Royal Palace. Currently, there 
were seven princes in the palace. The oldest was thirty-two, and the 
youngest was…well, the youngest didn’t really matter. 
In this country, when a prince was born, he was put in command 
of a number of imperial guards. The guards under a prince’s 
command would be his eyes and ears, so to speak, and would teach 
him how to influence people. If he played his cards right, the 
numbers of his guards would increase, and if he did something bad, 
they would decrease. When a king passed away, the prince with the 
102    
most guards under his command would inherit the throne. That was 
the tradition in this country. The more guards you had under your 
command, the more power you wielded.
Under this system, the person with the most guards under his 
command was the First Prince. He was aware of his position as the 
oldest, and while he was a bit arrogant, he still conducted himself in 
a way that was appropriate for a member of the royal family. As a 
result, he had nearly thirty guards under his command.
So who was it that had the fewest under their command, then? 
Was it the one scorned by the soldiers, the Seventh Prince Pax 
Shirone? It was true that he had few guards under his command. At 
the moment, he only had three. At one point, this number had 
dwindled to just one, but Pax acquired a contact in the lawless area 
where the slave market was held, and increased that number by one. 
I’ll get to the third member in a moment.
Pax didn’t have many guards, but there was someone who had 
even fewer than him. That was the Third Prince Zanoba Shirone. He 
had exactly zero people under his command. He didn’t even have a 
single guard. Just a few years prior, he’d had Ginger—the twelfth 
strongest knight in the kingdom—under his command. But even she, 
the last of his guards, was traded away to Pax for a certain figurine. 
Ginger had tried to submit her resignation, but Pax took her family 
hostage in a panic, forcing her to grudgingly become the third 
member of his guard. 
Now then, about the Third Prince Zanoba Shirone. He was 
actually a Blessed Child, born with a superhuman ability which made 
him unusually strong. Although his power was not a terribly 
exceptional one, the king still rejoiced when he was born, for this 
Blessed Child would be of great help to his country in the future. 
Considering the Conflict Zone just north of the kingdom, the birth of 
anyone whose strength could be used in battle called for people to 
throw their hands up in celebration. Zanoba’s birth mother was a 
103    
concubine, but his birth came as a joy to her, an assurance that she’d 
fulfilled her role. 
The day when the hands raised in joy came falling down was just 
three years after Zanoba’s birth, when the Fourth Prince was born. 
Fourth numerically, but the first born to the crowned queen. The 
child was treated like a precious jewel, eliciting joy from all as a party 
was thrown in celebration. 
In the midst of that party, the three-year-old Zanoba shuffled up 
to where his brother was sprawled out in his bed. He reached out, 
touched his brother, and said, “How cute,” and “You’re just like a 
doll.” Everyone smiled as they listened. Zanoba was very fond of 
dolls, so it warmed their hearts that he likened his little brother to 
his favorite thing.
But then Zanoba tore off his little brother’s head as if he were a 
doll, and the party erupted in a pandemonium of screams. 
The king and his queen were driven mad, condemning Zanoba’s 
mother to exile. Zanoba remained in the country—in part because he 
was still young, but also because he was a Blessed Child. That was 
just how important Blessed Children were in this world. But as a 
result of that incident, Zanoba’s guards dwindled from eight to just 
three. On top of that, the king ordered that he was not allowed to 
have more than that number.
The next incident occurred when he was fifteen. Although 
Zanoba still was a doll fanatic, he was now at an age where he could 
now distinguish between human and doll. That was why he was 
paired with a wife, the daughter of a powerful family that had 
withstood countless attacks from the country of Vista in the Conflict 
Zone. It seemed the king intended to put Zanoba on the front lines in
the event of a war with Vista.
The wedding ceremony concluded seamlessly—but that was the 
only thing that was seamless, because the day after their first night 
104    
together, his bride was discovered in his bed with her head missing. 
Zanoba had pulled it off. The bride’s family, mad with anger that 
their daughter had been murdered, rose in rebellion, only to be 
suppressed. The king took two people from Zanoba’s guard and 
confined him to the inside of the castle. Then he tried to take 
Zanoba’s favorite doll from him, but each of the soldiers who tried to 
carry out that duty had their heads ripped off.
After that incident, Zanoba became known as the Head-Ripping 
Prince. Everything he had done could not be overlooked, even as a 
Blessed Child. He was a madman who had killed the kingdom’s 
legitimate heir and his own wife. The king even began to consider 
execution. 
But as long as Zanoba had a doll, everything was fine. As long as 
he was periodically gifted a doll, he caused no harm. So, with time, 
the king began to see him as a dangerous weapon that just 
happened to have the shape of a human. After that, Zanoba was 
treated with exceptional caution. And that brings us to the present 
day.
I’m telling the story with bravado now, but I only found all of 
this out after it was all over. At the time, I didn’t know that Zanoba 
was the strongest military power the Shirone Kingdom possessed.
   
Several hours passed after Zanoba told me to leave everything 
to him and strode off. He came back with his lips spread in a huge 
grin. In comparison, my lips were probably stretched taut in a line.
Zanoba just beamed at me as he held something in his hand. 
“Master, how about this? Now will you make me your pupil?”
“Ow, ow, ow, ow!! Stop it! Please, elder brother, stop!”
105    
“Shut it, Pax!” Zanoba hissed back.
“Aaaaagaaaaah!”
The person he’d dragged in with him was his brother, Pax 
Shirone. I could see blood dripping from where Zanoba grasped his 
head. It wasn’t Pax’s blood, though. It was Zanoba’s body which was 
entirely drenched in red.
I lost the ability to speak. I didn’t know what was going on. I 
thought we’d had a light-hearted conversation about him being my 
pupil or something, but somewhere along the line it had become a 
gorefest. A smiling, blood-covered face only had appeal when it was 
that of a beautiful woman. The expression just looked bizarre when it 
was being worn by a gangly, nerdy-looking older brother character. 
A number of people filed in behind Zanoba, as if they’d been 
following him. The first was Ginger, with her sword unsheathed. 
Three more knights in similar attire crowded in after her.
“Stop it, Zanoba! Take your hands off of him!”
“Th-that’s right, Zanoba, please get ahold of yourself…!”
Hidden behind the knights were two princes dressed in 
expensive-looking clothing. Although I called them both princes, one 
was a bit too old to really fit the title. Regardless, there were nine of 
us (myself included) crammed into the tight little space that was this 
narrow room.
“Elder brother, did you know that Pax took the soldiers’ families 
hostages so he could force them to do his bidding?”
“N-no…”
“And I do mean soldiers, the ones under the command of our 
father, not his own personal guard.” Zanoba was grinning, mouth 
stretched wide as he spoke. “It seems he took Ginger’s family 
hostage as well.”
“Is that true?”
106    
“Yes, sir,” Ginger answered, her sword still held aloft.
The smile remained on Zanoba’s face. “Elder brothers, do you 
remember Roxy?”
“Y-yes. She was Pax’s tutor…”
“A King-tier Water Magician, who taught our country’s soldiers 
the secrets to facing a magician in battle, a person to whom we owe 
a great debt. Didn’t our father try to officially invite her to stay at the 
royal palace? And was it not Pax’s foolish actions that sabotaged and 
destroyed our relationship with her?”
“W-well yes…that’s true, Pax was in the wrong, but still, you—”
“And yet despite this…see for yourselves. Her pupil, my mas—I 
mean, Lord Rudeus—is being insulted like this. By Pax’s doing. The 
very pupil that Master Roxy said had even more talent than herself. 
Lord Rudeus, a true genius.” Zanoba’s smile never once faltered. 
“Y-you always looked so bored when you attended parliament, 
but you were actually listening? As your brother, this brings me great 
relief. I was sure that you didn’t care at all about what happened to 
our country.”
“Elder brother, I’m only interested in dolls. All I’m doing now is 
revealing the truth of Pax’s unlawful behavior. And there’s only one 
reason why I’m doing that,” Zanoba declared, lifting Pax into the air.
“Oooow!”
“Lord Rudeus is a wonderfully skilled, unsurpassable figurine 
maker. I cannot forgive someone like that being used as a pawn in 
Pax’s revenge scheme!”
“Aaaaah! My head’s gonna split open! It’s gonna split! Gonna 
spliiiit!” Pax’s wail of pain reverberated throughout the room.
“Elder brother, if you decide to take Pax’s side in this, I will act 
out.”
107    
The three knights and two princes went deathly pale. I wanted 
to jump in and say, “You’re already doing the ‘acting out’ part just 
fine!” but the chill in the air told me that his definition of “act out” 
was on another level from what he’d already done.
“I’m not asking for anything difficult,” Zanoba said. “I just want 
to save this figurine maker and Pax’s bad behavior is inhibiting my 
ability to do that.”
“But without Pax, the slave market is—”
“Elder brother, please don’t make me say it again. Your younger 
brother’s head is about to be torn off.” Zanoba wasn’t smiling 
anymore.
I had no idea what was going on. I was just confused, wondering 
if the words “torn off” were a metaphor. The one thing I did know 
was that the person in command of this situation was Zanoba. Go on, 
my pupil, you can do it! Even though you’re still scary as hell!
“Nooooo, no! Stop it! Let go! Gingerrr! Save me! Don’t you care 
what—what happens to your family!”
“My family? They were all saved by Master Ruijerd last night,” 
she answered.
“Whaat?!” Pax struggled in his brother’s grasp as Ginger coolly 
refused him.
Ruijerd had saved someone? Well, he was always saving people. 
I had no idea what was going on, but it seemed like things had been 
proceeding behind the scenes.
“Now you see where things stand, elder brothers. I have the 
least authority among us princes, and that is why I’ve come to enlist 
your help. If you should refuse, I will act out with every last ounce of 
strength I possess. From this distance, I could take one or perhaps 
both of your heads and rip them off. Though I’m sure the court 
magicians would burn me alive afterwards.”
108    
With this, one of the two (whom I assumed were the First and 
Second Princes) finally broke. “O-okay, fine! We’ll do what you ask!”
“Be sure you look into this thoroughly, yes? Also, that girl who 
created all that fuss two years ago, Lilia, is being held captive 
somewhere in this castle. I’d like you to secure her as well.”
“Yes, of course. I’ll be sure to let Father know, too.”
At that time, I didn’t know that Zanoba was a Blessed Child. I 
just thought he had a ridiculous amount of confidence for someone 
so gangly. It’s dangerous to overestimate your own strength like that, 
I thought, though it struck me as seriously odd how the two princes 
seemed so intent on defending Pax.
But as it turned out, I was mistaken. They were just terrified of 
Zanoba, the kind of terror you felt when faced with a bomb that was 
seconds from exploding. Even as I was released from the barrier, I 
still didn’t understand. Dumbstruck, I watched as Pax was carried off, 
Lilia was released, and the whole issue came to a close.
   
Several days passed before I finally learned everything that had 
happened. Let’s start with how Lilia wound up being detained in the 
first place. 
At the time, she was suspected of being a spy from a foreign 
power. When she was interrogated, she invoked Paul’s and Roxy’s 
names, which managed to keep her out of prison, but didn’t 
completely dispel their suspicions. Instead, she was confined to the 
palace. When information about the Displacement Incident finally 
reached the Shirone Kingdom and it seemed like she might be 
released, Pax interfered and began manipulating the flow of 
109    
information, which meant Lilia and Aisha were forced to remain 
inside the castle.
When Roxy fled, Pax established contacts in the slave market. 
Through them, he hired his own private army, then took some of his 
father’s soldiers’ families hostage to force their obedience. Those 
soldiers searched the slums in secret, and found where the hostages 
were being kept, but rescuing them proved difficult because they 
were heavily guarded. Frustratingly, they had to wait, and the days 
slipped by.
It was during that time that Aisha made her escape and the 
prince gave orders to pursue her. Reluctantly, the soldiers did as they 
were told and managed to track her down. That was when I 
appeared and made a magnificent show of carrying her off. Once the 
soldiers saw how I was trying to help Aisha, plus how I could cast 
spells without chanting, they realized I was Roxy’s pupil. That was 
when they began to devise their plan. 
First, they started a fight in the slave market to throw it into 
chaos. Then, they used the fact that Aisha had been kidnapped by a 
mysterious man to get Pax’s private army moving. After that, they’d
planned to explain their circumstances to me and ask for my 
assistance in rescuing the hostages. I would help them attack the 
place where the hostages were being held now that its security was 
weakened, and in return, they would find a way to save Lilia for me.
But before any of that could happen, I sent my letter to the 
palace, mistakenly thinking Roxy was still in the country, and was 
then lured in and confined by Pax. If I had just waited another day 
before sending my letter, I could have listened to the soldiers’ story 
and been the one to lure Pax into a trap, instead. Perhaps the ManGod had intended for me to save Aisha and then write my letter, not 
the other way around.
110    
My capture should have been a setback for the soldiers, but 
when they went to the inn to find me, they found Ruijerd instead. He 
listened to what they had to say, got all riled up, and soon enough, 
he’d rescued all the hostages. Once the hostages were safely 
returned to their families, Ruijerd intended to charge the castle. The 
soldiers tried to tell him they would do it themselves, but he 
wouldn’t listen.
Ginger, meanwhile, wasn’t made aware of any of this. The 
soldiers had left her out of it because they worried it would be 
dangerous to involve someone under Pax’s command. Poor thing. 
However, when the hostages were released, Ginger’s family was 
spotted among them, so the soldiers took them into protective 
custody as well.
Ginger, thinking this was a good opportunity for her to make a 
move, passed on my Ruijerd figurine to Zanoba—the man with the 
most brute strength in this country. She’d calculated that he smight 
see me as a valuable source of information and ally himself with me, 
but was also motivated by the fact that she’d sworn allegiance to 
Zanoba. Why would someone like Ginger remain loyal to someone 
who had traded her off in exchange for a figurine? There had to be a 
story there.
Anyway, the very next day, Zanoba killed two of Pax’s imperial 
guards before taking Pax hostage. With that, the soldiers never got 
to carry out the last step of their plan. Instead, the incident came to 
a surprising close.
After all of that came to light, the king handed down his orders. 
First, Pax was to be banished from the country. It was unfortunate 
that this meant the loss of his contacts in the slave market, but it set 
a terrible precedent that he’d not only taken his soldiers’ families 
captive, but the family of one of his imperial guards as well. On top 
of that, instead of gently coaxing a magician such as myself to join 
111    
the royal family, he took me captive and tried to use me as bait to 
lure Roxy so he could assault and kill her. 
In the interest of maintaining appearances, they claimed Pax 
was being sent off to study abroad. In reality, they sent him to the 
King Dragon Realm to be kept as a hostage—one whose death would 
be inconsequential.
As for Zanoba, he was also banished from the country. Again, 
they officially claimed he was studying abroad. His banishment was 
proposed by the first and second princes, who claimed the situation 
was partially his fault. In all honesty, they were probably just terrified 
of having such a nuclear warhead nearby, not knowing when he 
would explode or if they would be caught in the blast. The king 
seemed reluctant to let Zanoba go, but it seemed that dolls could no 
longer reliably rein him in, and he was tired of all the problems 
Zanoba had caused thus far.
Lilia was released, although some still claimed that she was a 
spy for another country. To curry favor with Pax, she’d apparently 
been gathering information for him behind the scenes. It just went to 
show how amazing our Lilia was, that she could do something like 
that even in captivity. 
In order to silence those claims, she was to be escorted all the 
way to Paul. Not to the Asura Kingdom, but to Paul. It did make 
sense, given that even if they did send her off to the Asura Kingdom, 
no one there could verify her identity. Paul currently had stronger 
ties to the Holy Country of Millis, and it was probably better to stay 
there than arouse unnecessary suspicion by returning home.
I was worried they might kill her on the way to keep her from 
talking, but Ginger volunteered to go along with her for protection. 
Zanoba had apparently commanded her to protect his master’s 
family. Some of the soldiers whom Ruijerd had saved also offered to 
accompany them, so that put my mind at ease.
112    
As for myself, the king personally invited me to stay in the 
region, offering to prepare a place for me as a court magician. Given 
his tone of voice and the way he sighed as he spoke, I could tell he 
knew he was asking the impossible. And of course, I refused. When I 
did, the king sighed again and told me I could leave.
That was all. There was no apology. The offenders were a royal 
family, after all. They weren’t the type to apologize. The beastfolk 
had been more honorable, in that respect. 
Once everything was over and I tried to leave the royal palace, 
Zanoba clung to me in tears.
“Maaaster! Are you truly going to leave? Are you truly going to 
leave your pupil behind?!”
“I’m sorry, but I have to hurry along on my journey.”
“Then could you at least make me a figurine before you go?!” 
“Those take a lot of time to make, so I’m afraid I can’t.”
“Nooo!” The fact that I wouldn’t make a figurine for Zanoba 
made him so sad that he clung to me and wailed in anguish.
By now, I’d heard that he was a Blessed Child. I knew he was the 
prince who had massacred people by ripping their heads off, and I 
was on edge, wondering if he would suddenly decide to take my 
head off as well. Don’t get me wrong, I was grateful. But that didn’t 
change the fact that he was terrifying.
“If we happen to meet again, I’ll teach you how to make one of 
my figurines from scratch,” I said.
“What?!” he exclaimed. “No, but I—I mean, are you sure? Isn’t 
that a top-secret skill of your trade?”
“What kind of pupil would you be if I didn’t teach you 
anything?”
“Waaaaaaah, Maaaaster!” he wailed, and threw me in the air. 
113    
I slammed against the ceiling.
“O-oh noooo!” Zanoba screeched. “Ginger! Healing magic!!”
“Yes, sir!” Ginger chanted a healing spell and my wounds closed. 
Zanoba, who had nearly killed me, was now pale and flustered. He 
looked relieved when I rose back up, healthy again. I seriously 
considered excommunicating him right then and there, then 
reconsidered quickly. I didn’t want him to rip my head off.
“All right, Master. Stay safe! I don’t know where I’ll be shipped 
off to, but I have a feeling I’ll eventually run into you again!”
“Cough… yeah, you too.”
Zanoba continued sobbing as he nodded, watching me go. 
Ginger watched the two of us with tears running down her cheeks as 
well.
And that was how matters in the Shirone Kingdom came to a 
close. Lilia and Aisha had been saved and sent off to Paul. Pax was 
banished from the country. I gained a pupil in the form of Zanoba. 
Some parts didn’t go as smoothly as they could have, since I didn’t 
follow the Man-God’s advice perfectly. Still, everything ended in the 
best way possible.
It still felt like I was dancing right into the palm of the god’s 
hand. It felt like I was watching a terrible play unfold. 
And yet, everything seemed to be going in the right direction. 
Lilia and Aisha were both in good health. I didn’t know what to think 
about Zanoba, but at least he didn’t harbor any ill feelings toward 
me. I was sure Pax still hated me, but he’d been booted out of the 
country without any pawns to manipulate.
Leaving the ugly details aside, everything had turned out in a 
way beneficial to me. Come to think of it, none of the paths the ManGod had directed me on had led to disadvantageous results. Perhaps 
114    
it was best to put more trust in him? No—a con artist only started 
duping people after they’d proven themselves successful once. I 
needed to exercise caution until I could be certain he was 
trustworthy. 
That said, a promise was a promise. I wouldn’t take a hostile 
attitude with him the next time.
115    
We were at an inn in a small town within the Shirone 
Kingdom. It was here that the road forked, one path leading to the 
Holy Country of Millis and the other to the Asura Kingdom. This was 
where I was going to part with Lilia and the others. 
Lilia and I sat at a table together, facing each other.
“That’s right! Ru—I mean, the Kennel Master is really incredible! 
If he gets serious, he can make rain flood over the forest and then 
freeze it solid!”
“You’re talking about magic, right? That’s amazing!”
“Of course! I have even more astonishing stories than that one. 
Want to hear?”
“Yeah, please tell me about them!”
Eris’ and Aisha’s voices flooded in from the outside window. Eris 
was boasting about the Kennel Master’s accomplishments. I smiled 
bitterly and turned my attention to Lilia. The two of us had talked a 
bit here and there in the past, but how was I supposed to approach 
her now? 
While I was thinking, Lilia took the opportunity to strike up 
conversation first.
“Let me thank you once again, Lord Rudeus. I can’t even begin 
to express how grateful I am that you’ve saved my life not just once, 
but twice now.”
“Please don’t worry about it,” I said. “I didn’t do anything this 
time.”
116    
“No. I heard how you caught a whisper of information about us 
and went out of your way to come to the Shirone Kingdom,” Lilia said 
as she bowed her head low.
All I did was follow the Man-God’s directions. And then 
needlessly got myself stuck in a trap and needed help to escape it. If I 
still had the nerve to demand gratitude after all that, I should’ve 
been able to use that same nerve to accomplish more in my previous 
life.
“Please direct that gratitude to Ruijerd and Eris instead. They’re 
the ones who acted appropriately and led everything to a peaceful 
conclusion.”
“I spoke with them a bit,” she said. “But they told me it was all 
part of your strategy—”
“That was not my strategy.”
Lilia went quiet, then said, “If that’s how you feel.” She looked 
displeased, but it wasn’t like I was asking her to call something black 
when it was really white.
We fell into silence for a bit after that.
“Does Aisha…” Lilia began to ask, glancing outside the window, 
“…sometimes say things that are offensive?”
“Of course not. She’s an exceptional kid. No normal child could 
put that much forethought into their actions at six.” 
“But she’s not as great as you. I tried to teach her as much as I 
could these past few years, but even now, my daughter’s too stupid 
to understand how amazing you are, Lord Rudeus.”
“Calling her stupid is going a bit overboard.” Besides, I’d had an 
advantage in the form of the memories from my previous life. I had 
considered the possibility that Aisha might be the same as me, but 
when I tried asking her about the existence of things like television 
and cellphones, she just stared blankly at me. The girl was just an 
117    
ordinary genius. Paul’s genes, as it turned out, were actually pretty 
incredible.
“What do you think of Aisha?” Lilia asked, as if the question had 
just popped into her head.
“Huh? I told you, she’s exceptional.”
“I don’t mean that. I mean her appearance.”
“I think she’s cute,” I said.
Lilia pressed on. “She’s my daughter. Do you think her bosom 
will develop as she grows?”
Uhh…what? I had no interest in my little sister’s chest. Besides, 
what the heck were we talking about here?
“Lord Rudeus, if you intend to travel to Asura, please take Aisha 
along with you. I have to return to the Master’s side, but Aisha can 
go along with you, can’t she?”
“Can you tell me why you’re asking this?” I deflected the 
conversation back at her.
“I’ve told her every single day that she would one day serve 
you.”
“So it would seem.”
“I’ve taught her every single thing I know. She’s still young, but 
give her a few years and she’ll have a body that all the boys will 
love.”
A body all the boys will love, huh?
“Wait just a second. She’s my little sister, you realize?”
“I know that you’re a womanizer.”
She did? Huh, okay then. Still, unlike my former self, it seemed I 
felt no desire for those related to me by blood. Which was why it 
made me uncomfortable when Lilia presented Aisha to me as if she 
were a gourmet meal prepared for my consumption. Those were my 
118    
true feelings, at least. “She’s still only six, isn’t she? She’s at an age 
where she needs to be with her parents.”
“If that’s how you truly feel,” she said.
Lilia looked disappointed, but I said nothing wrong. Aisha was 
still young. It was best for her to be with her parents, right? It was 
my feeling, as someone who was born Japanese, that it was best for 
a child to be with both of their parents while they were little. At least 
one, if not both, but definitely not neither.
“I understand. It’s true that Aisha is still immature. I can’t send 
her off with you when she’s still so inexperienced.”
“Uh, please don’t teach her anything too weird, okay? 
Like…about me being a pervert.”
“I’ve only ever told her how wonderful you are,” she replied.
“And because of that, she seems to be rebelling…”
“Indeed. Though only for the moment,” Lilia said with a quiet 
laugh, lifting her face. Her expression was bright and sunny.
I couldn’t take Aisha with me, but I’d already received some 
precious things from Lilia. One of those things was hanging around 
my neck on a leather cord. The other was tucked away in a box for 
safekeeping. I wasn’t going to part with it ever again.
“Thank you for the pendant.” (And panties.)
“It was no problem. I know how precious those are to you.” 
There was a hidden meaning in her words, of course, since she really 
meant the panties. I owed her a lot for everything she’d done for me.
“So, um…I guess carrying these around really does make people 
think I’m a pervert?”
“A pervert? Is that something Aisha said to you?” Lilia suddenly 
leaped out of her chair. I had to make a grand show of getting her to 
sit back down, where she let out a small sigh. “She was relatively free 
119    
to move about the castle, so someone must have put strange things 
in her head.”
Strange things, yes. Very strange indeed.
“If underwear is enough to call someone a pervert, then what 
would happen if she went to work at the Asura Royal Palace?”
“The Asura Royal Palace?” I asked. “Come to think of it, you said 
you used to work in the inner palace, right?”
“Yes. Compared to what I saw there, you and the Master 
couldn’t even begin to be described as perverts.”
“Oh…really…” Apparently, the Asura Royal Palace was where the 
real gentlemen gathered. It made sense considering there was a 
certain noble family that I already knew loved furries. Nah—It wasn’t 
just the Greyrats that had such proclivities. The Shirone royal family 
was pretty terrible, too.
“One of them enjoyed women’s vaginal—”
“Nope, I don’t need a detailed picture, thanks.” I didn’t need to 
go any further than that.
“Anyway, there are many among the royal and noble families 
whose preferences run toward the perverse. Compared to that, 
having an interest in the underwear of someone you look up to is 
rather normal.” Lilia gazed off into the distance as she spoke. She 
was probably reliving an unpleasant memory.
“Please give Father my regards,” I said.
“Understood.”
“I’ll give you some money to cover the trip, but if it seems like it 
won’t be enough, just stop at an Adventurers’ Guild and seek out 
one of Father’s subordinates,” I advised.
“Understood.”
“I’m sure these soldiers escorting you can be trusted. But just in 
case, exercise extreme caution. They’re still strangers.”
120    
“There’s no problem there. I’m acquainted with all of them.”
“Oh, you are? Then, um…”
“Lord Rudeus.” Just as I was busy scrambling through my 
thoughts for anything else to say, Lilia stood up, walked over to me, 
and then hugged me to her chest. Her voluminous breasts 
smothered my face, and my breathing suddenly went erratic.
“Um, Miss Lilia, they’re in my face.”
“You still haven’t changed from when you were little,” she said 
with a small laugh.
The next day, before we took off, Eris, Ruijerd and I performed 
the final check on our carriage to make sure nothing was amiss. Lilia 
and the others were going to leave before us and had already 
switched over to a different carriage.
“Mister Kennel Master, Mister Kennel Master!” Aisha came 
flying out of the carriage, scrambling across the ground toward me.
“What is it?”
“Just a moment.” She grabbed the hem of my shirt and dragged 
me along with her. I shot Ruijerd a look so he would understand, 
then went ahead and followed her.
The place she brought me to was a small thicket by the 
roadside. She crouched and gestured for me to follow suit. I did as 
she asked and leaned in close as if we were about to have a secret 
conversation. 
“Mister Kennel Master, I actually have a favor I want to ask of 
you, privately.”
“A favor? If it’s something I can do, sure.” If my cute little sister 
had a task for me, I would do my best to fulfill it. Norn already hated 
me, and I didn’t want Aisha to hate me, too. I seemed to be in her 
121    
good graces for now, but that was because she thought I was the 
Kennel Master. 
“Please take me along with you.”
My eyes went wide when I heard her ask that. Was this Lilia’s 
doing…?
“Did your mom tell you to say that?” Perhaps she thought that 
since I refused her request, she’d use her daughter’s tears to 
persuade me instead. Lilia was more cunning than I gave her credit 
for.
“No, there’s no way my mother would be okay with that.”
“Hm?”
“Every single day, my mother tells me about how I’m going to 
serve my half-brother in the future.”
“She did say that,” I agreed.
“But!” Aisha slammed her fist against the ground. “I want no 
part of it!”
She really wanted no part of being around me. Probably 
because I got so aroused by underwear. Sorry, I apologized in my 
head.
“We talked about it the other day, right? My brother is a 
pervert. I understand what you were saying, Mister Kennel Master, 
but I just can’t bear the thought of serving someone like that.”
“Is that right…?” 
“So please, I beg of you, save me! Just as gallantly as you did the 
other day, from the evil hands of a pervert!”
“I’m going to pass on that.” This was no joke. If the two of us 
traveled together, she’d learn my real name eventually. And when 
she found out I’d lied to her…wait. We were family, so she was going 
to find out eventually anyway, right?
122    
“Why not?! He’s a pervert!”
“That’s just your imagination, not the facts,” I said.
Okay! Let’s set the record straight right here. If I entrusted this 
task to Lilia, I’d probably be known as a pervert forever. It didn’t 
matter how much she said those in the royal palace were far worse 
than me—that wasn’t going to change Aisha’s impression of me. 
“You’ve never actually met him, have you?”
“But there’s no mistaking those panties!”
“Maybe there’s a reason for those,” I suggested.
“And what reason could he have for treasuring panties?!”
Why? That wasn’t really something I had a ready answer 
for…but, for instance, in monotheistic religions, people worshipped 
the clothing that a holy person wore, right? That was especially true 
when you considered these were the panties Roxy wore when she 
was rocking her one-handed lady band. This was a rare item that 
only the highest-level players possessed! If you were a player that 
cared about that kind of stuff, what would you do with it? You’d 
treasure it for the rest of your life, of course! The motto of my 
personal faith was “Lust and studies are both important!” Combine 
the two and you got sexual studies, the golden standard!
Anyway, that aside…
“Roxy was your brother’s former tutor, correct?”
“Yes,” she answered.
“So she’s had a great impact on your brother, right?”
“I suppose so…”
There was no “suppose.” I was her big brother, so I knew what I 
was saying. Roxy was the person who helped me do something that I 
hadn’t been able to do in nearly twenty years. The reason I was living 
my life like this was because of Roxy.
123    
“Then perhaps he wants to treasure it as an item that someone 
incredibly important to him wore.”
“Hmmm…” She didn’t seem satisfied by that explanation. In that 
case, why not give her an item that her idol the Kennel Master had 
been wearing? 
I retrieved something from my pocket. “I’ve used this forehead 
protector for a really long time.”
“Why are you bringing this up all of a sudden?”
“Because I’m giving it to you.” I handed the forehead protector 
to her. It was something I’d bought a long time ago, back when we 
were in Rikarisu. Even though I’d washed it since, it still had a trace 
of my sweat, since I’d been using it for so long.
Aisha looked a little shocked as she cradled it in her hand. “Ah! 
Now I kind of understand.”
“Does it make more sense emotionally now, than it did when I 
just explained it with words?”
“Yeah, I get it now! So my brother wasn’t a pervert!”
And thus, I passed on the forehead protector I’d used for so 
long. That said, this kid was way too trusting.
“Mister Kennel Master, you really are a good person!”
“I’m not that great.” I gave her my shining Rudeus Smile.
Aisha watched me with stars in her eyes, before she suddenly 
realized something and muttered to herself, “Oh yeah… Right now, 
my brother is still missing. If he’s dead, will you allow me to serve 
you instead?”
“No, I’m not sure about that.”
“You won’t let me?” she asked. “I’m sure you’ll understand after 
seeing my mom, but I think I’ll grow up to be pretty amazing. With a 
body all the boys will adore!”
124    
“‘A body all the boys will adore’… Do you even understand what 
that means?”
“It means a body that makes you want to start making babies 
when you see it, right?”
“A child shouldn’t talk about making babies,” I chided. At this 
rate, she’d be swept off by a pervert before she even came into her 
womanhood. Honestly, who the heck was teaching her this stuff?
“Is there nothing I can say that will change your mind? Do you 
hate me that much?” Her eyes glistened tearfully.
“All right, fine. If your brother is never found, then sure.”
“You mean it?”
I felt bad for deceiving her. By the time she was older, my 
journey would be over and we’d probably all be living together again 
as a happy family.
“Then you’re not mad at me for calling you a pervert?”
“No, of course no—huh?”
Wait, what did she just say?
“Thanks, big brother!” With that, Aisha shot back up and ran off 
to the carriage. I sat there dumbfounded as she leaped up into it. 
When the carriage rolled into motion, Aisha turned back to wave at 
me, and Lilia bowed. “See you, big brother! Let’s meet again! It’s a 
promise!”
And off they went.
Eris had a completely unamused look on her face as she said, 
“What the hell? She completely saw right through you.”
“H-how…?”
Ruijerd gave the horse’s reins a tug and the carriage jerked into 
motion. In retrospect, there were many opportunities for her to 
realize the truth. I called her by her name when we first met, and 
125    
when I was speaking to Eris and Ruijerd after that, I’m pretty sure 
they let my name slip, too.
So why did she pretend not to know? Think, think, I told myself, 
and the answer came quickly. She was probably trying to determine 
for herself if her brother was someone who could be trusted. If I’d 
kept up the charade of being the Kennel Master and tried to drag her 
along with me, I had no doubt she would’ve turned her back on me.
“Haha.” Once I realized that, I laughed. She truly was a brilliant, 
clever little girl. I looked forward to seeing her once she was older.
126    
We left Shirone Kingdom and traveled far, far westward. 
Our destination was the Asura Kingdom. The road leading to said 
country was flat and the weather just warm enough to make you 
drowsy. On either side of the highway were fields of grass as far as 
the eye could see, and directly ahead was the faint outline of the Red 
Wyrm Mountains. Above them, you could see slowly circling 
shadows. It was tranquil.
On occasion, bandits who totally couldn’t read the situation 
would approach and demand we drop our coin and leave. Eris would 
kindly grant them their wish by offering her iron fist, sending them 
scuttling off into the distance. Ruijerd wanted to slaughter them all 
at first, but once we heard how they were simply hurting for food, he 
decided to let them go for now. But just this once.
Even though this was the Central Continent, the highway around 
these parts wasn’t particularly safe. I wished they would take notes 
from the Demon Continent. Bandits never went out there, although 
in exchange, monsters showed up in ten times the number.
The fact that people could do as they pleased here was proof of 
how peaceful this region was. If we traveled just a bit farther to the 
north, there was a jumble of small countries duking it out. In fact, 
that conflict was probably the root cause for the rising number of 
bandits here.
Now let me explain the geographical features around these 
parts for a bit. The Red Wyrm Mountains were a huge mountain 
range that stretched across the Central Continent, splitting it in three 
parts, with Red Wyrms residing within them. Red Wyrms were said 
to be the strongest monsters on the Central Continent. Their 
127    
strength was fearsome enough one-on-one, but they typically 
gathered in hordes of several hundred. 
Of special note was their detection ability. They never missed 
anything that encroached on their territory, even animals as small as 
a dog. And it didn’t matter how fierce the opponent was—the wyrms 
would swarm together and devour it, bones and all. If you trespassed 
on their turf, you died. That was common knowledge in this world.
There were a number of different dragon species in this world. 
Every single one of them was A-ranked or higher. Among them, the 
Red Wyrm was the most ferocious and dangerous. A single one was a 
low S-rank, but they always came in groups and they always held 
vast territories. And since the mountain range was the place these 
creatures called home, it came to be known as the Red Wyrm 
Mountains: an impassable mountain range that was a symbol of 
death.
The Red Wyrms were dangerous beasts, but they actually had 
one weakness. They had excellent combat abilities, but were terrible 
fliers, and couldn’t take flight from flat terrain. To fly, they needed to 
leap off tall cliffs or run down a long slope. Although the Central 
Continent had tall mountains, the land was mostly occupied by 
rolling plains and forests. Therefore, it was rare for those living on 
the plains to be attacked by a Red Wyrm. 
Granted, there was the occasional idiot amongst the horde that 
would get caught by a turbulent wind or something and fall to the 
plains. The high king that falls from the heavens loses its power…or 
so the saying went, but these guys didn’t lose their power. Those 
that fell close to a human village wrecked havoc, bringing 
devastation to the area. When this happened, the villagers would call 
in soldiers or adventurers to deal with the disturbance. Even though 
these extermination requests were S-ranked, parties of about ten 
people were formed to lure the creature into a trap, making them
relatively easy to hunt. As it stood, dragon meat and bones were top-
128    
quality materials to make armor with, and their skin was highly 
valued as a work of art. Of course, it wasn’t just those parts which 
had value. The entire body of a wyrm could be utilized for something 
or other.
Although the prize money was distributed among teams of ten 
for taking down one of these creatures, it was still enough money for 
each of them to live lavishly for a year. To be more precise, one 
dragon was worth about one hundred gold pieces. Even though they 
couldn’t accept the mission directly, there were apparently a lot of Cranked newbies who would impulsively take on the challenge just for 
the lucrative materials they could harvest from a wyrm’s body. Of 
course, most of them were barbecued alive and then devoured.
There were two points of passage through these mountains in 
which vast numbers of Red Wyrms dwelled. These were gorges 
sandwiched between two sheer precipices, known respectively as 
the Red Wyrm’s Lower Jaw and the Red Wyrm’s Upper Jaw. These 
ravines had existed since the time of the Second Human-Demon War 
and were the only paths at the time that were wide enough for 
soldiers to pass through. Anticipating that, Laplace had taken the 
opportunity to unleash Red Wyrms on the armies that tried. Ruijerd 
confirmed that story, so there was no doubt about its veracity. 
Our carriage was moving toward the Red Wyrm’s Lower Jaw, 
which connected the southern and western regions of the Central 
Continent. Once we made it through there, we would be in the Asura 
Kingdom. However, we were taking a roundabout route to detour 
around the mountains, and there was a young miss amongst us who 
detested indirect paths.
“We don’t need to detour around this thing. We have Ruijerd 
with us; we could cut right through those mountains!” Eris said, 
being completely unreasonable as she looked at the Red Wyrms 
cutting slow circles in the sky above the mountain range.
129    
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Ruijerd answered with a bitter laugh.
I had considered that we might be able to cross the mountains 
with Ruijerd in our party, but even he found that idea impossible. In 
that case, I didn’t stand a chance. After all, I couldn’t defeat Ruijerd.
“But Rudeus could definitely do it!” Eris huffed.
“No, there’s no way. What are you talking about?”
“Ghislaine said that she slew a Red Wyrm straggler before!”
“She did?” I’d never heard that conversation. Maybe it wasn’t 
one of the stories from her time as an adventurer. If it had been, Paul 
would have surely boasted about it.
“From what I heard, she battled one before she became a Sword 
Saint!”
“Oh? All by herself?”
“Uh, well, there were about five others who were Advanced-tier 
swordfighters with her, she said.”
“And how many of them died?” I pressed on.
“Two,” Eris replied.
You moron, I thought. That meant their group took a 40% loss. 
What in the world made her think I could defeat one of those 
creatures? 
“Besides,” I said, “there’s a difference in strength between 
stragglers and the ones here in these mountains. After all, these ones 
are in the air, you know?”
Flight gave wyrms at a huge advantage against humans. This 
wasn’t a video game where having a flying trait made you weak to 
bows and arrows. Plus, they moved in swarms. It was one thing to 
face off against the King Dragons, whose groups consisted of only a 
few wyrms, or the Black Wyrms, which didn’t form flocks at all. With 
the way Red Wyrms swarmed in the hundreds, there was no way you 
could hope to pick them off one by one. “Am I right, Mister Ruijerd?”
130    
“Yes. You don’t have a hope of standing against a Red Wyrm 
horde. If there was anyone that could, they would be the mightiest 
champion amongst the Seven Great Powers. Even the North God and 
Sword God would likely turn back halfway through.”
“You really think so?” Wow. I thought the Seven Great Powers 
could easily dispatch dragons, but it seemed I was wrong.
“Yeah, their stamina would most likely wear out halfway 
through. Not like you could sleep with dragons around.”
That made sense. You’d have several hundred of them attacking 
you restlessly, even at night. Combat strength aside, they’d 
overwhelm you with sheer numbers.
“That said, Laplace subjugated the King of the Red Wyrms, so 
those ranked at the top of the Seven Great Powers could probably 
pass through without issue. Though if we’re speaking of the Seven 
Great Powers of old, even the God in last place could have passed 
through the Red Wyrm’s territory undisturbed, I’m sure.”
“But I’d still like to hunt one of them someday…” Once again, 
Eris was voicing her usual dangerous ideas. I was sure I’d be enlisted 
to help her when that “someday” came. 
   
Another tranquil day. Just a few more and we’d arrive at the 
Red Wyrm’s Lower Jaw. 
I was thinking about the Man-God while I prepped a meal for 
the party. More specifically, about what happened in the Shirone 
Kingdom a few days ago. To be perfectly honest, it felt like things 
were going a little too well for me. Perhaps the Man-God, his 
premonition notwithstanding, also had the power to change the 
future.
131    
No. Even if I hadn’t been carrying that figurine with me, I had a 
feeling Ginger would have lured Zanoba into meeting me anyway. 
And he would still have brought his Roxy figurine, still have given the 
same speech, and I would have still pointed out the mole he’d 
removed.
What if I had actually used my real name with Aisha? Alone at 
an inn with her perverted brother… If I were her, I’d have feared for 
my chastity. Aisha was a clever girl. She was trying to get a letter 
sent, so she might have stolen my money and made a run for it. 
I was sure I would’ve searched for her if that had happened. As 
soon as I knew she was missing, I would lose all composure and, 
without any thought for the consequences, blast my magic into the 
air to make contact with Ruijerd. I’d tell him that I’d found my sister 
but she ran away, and he’d help me search for her. He was kind to 
children. I was sure she’d trust him.
The more I considered it, the more I started to think that the 
Man-God’s advice was meant to ensure things turned out more or 
less the same way no matter what I did. It was probably happening 
right now. Even if we hadn’t decided to accept Ruijerd’s help, he 
would somehow have ended up traveling with us, anyway. No matter 
which eye I selected from Kishirika’s arsenal when I met her, I 
would’ve still been captured by the Doldia tribe in the Great Forest.
The Man-God was taking a lot into consideration as he gave me 
advice. Perhaps I could trust him. However, just as before, I couldn’t 
fathom his motives. If I could just figure out what he wanted, then I 
could be more honest with him.
As I mulled over my conversations with the Man-God, Eris and 
Ruijerd were sparring together as usual. Lately, Eris had gotten so 
strong it was a real eye-opener. Just a year ago, I could’ve beaten her 
easily by using my demon eye. I might even have been able to pull 
her panties down in the midst of combat. Now, that was impossible. I 
132    
would probably still come out on top if I used my demon eye and all 
of my mana, but even then, it would be close. I’d certainly win if we 
started the battle with some distance between us, but a longdistance battle would rob me of the possibility of physical contact 
during the heat of battle, so you couldn’t really call that a victory.
Back to the conversation about talent. I thought I worked pretty 
hard, but Eris went above and beyond. The quality and quantity of 
her hard work put mine to shame. My body just couldn’t keep up. 
My stamina was pretty average by Japanese standards, but by the 
standards of this world, I was mediocre. 
As I was preoccupied with those thoughts, the day’s training 
came to an end. “We’re done.”
“Haa, haa… yeah…”
Lately Ruijerd had stopped asking Eris if she understood their 
training or not. It didn’t need to be said anymore. Eris was naturally 
soaking it up.
“Eris,” Ruijerd suddenly said, as she came over to where I was 
standing.
“What?” Eris took the wet rag I’d wrung out and handed to her. 
She slipped it inside her clothes, wiping away at the sweat. She used 
to strip down to just her bra and wipe it off, but I got too turned on 
by that, so now she kept her clothes on, even though it probably felt 
gross having all that sweat on her body. Sorry, I apologized internally.
“From this day on, you can call yourself a warrior,” Ruijerd said 
as he sat himself down.
A warrior, huh? Not a swordfighter, but a warrior? Why was 
he…? Ah. I finally understood what he meant.
Eris slipped her hand under her armpit to wipe away the sweat, 
then stopped. “Does that mean…?”
“You’re an adult now,” Ruijerd said quietly.
133    
Eris’ movements went jerky as she tossed the rag back to me. I 
used water magic to rinse it, then twisted it tight and smacked it in 
the air to wring it out. Eris took a seat beside me. I’d seen this 
expression on her face before. It was the kind where she was so 
happy that a big grin was threatening to spread across her face, but 
she was trying to hold it back, thinking she needed to act more 
reserved. “B-but, Ruijerd, I still haven’t defeated you at all!”
“That’s not a problem. You already have a sufficient amount of 
strength as a warrior.” Perhaps this was his way of giving Eris his 
approval. Just as Ghislaine had when she permitted Eris to use the 
title of Advanced swordswoman, Ruijerd was now doing the same by 
telling Eris she could call herself a warrior.
“Congratulations, Eris,” I said.
Her eyes darted to me in surprise. “R-Rudeus, this isn’t a dream, 
is it? Could you pinch me?”
“You won’t punch me if I do?”
“I won’t punch you.”
Since I had her word, I reached out and pinched her nipple 
between my fingers. Gently, of course. Or maybe sexily is more the 
word in this case? 
Eris’ fist, on the other hand, was not gentle. “Where the hell are 
you pinching?!”
“Sorry…but it’s not a dream. If it was, this wouldn’t hurt so bad,” 
I said, face turning pale as I clutched my jaw. In contrast, Eris’ face 
was bright red as she covered her chest with her arms.
“That’s right, a warrior…” She looked down at the palm of her 
hand as if she could finally feel the power that was held there.
“But don’t get a big head. That means I’m not going to treat you 
like a child anymore. Got it?” Ruijerd sounded more like a parent 
warning their child.
134    
“Yeah!” Eris wore a meek look as she responded, although her 
cheeks were twitching, threatening to give away her grin. 
Our meal today looked even more delicious than usual.
That night, just as Eris was settling down to sleep, something 
was bothering me. I called to Ruijerd, who was on lookout with his 
eyes closed. “Why did you say that to Eris?”
He cracked his eyes open slightly and looked at me. “Because no 
matter how much time passes, you keep treating her like she’s a 
child.”
…Okay, let’s think about this. Was Eris a child or not? She was 
twenty years younger than I’d been when I died in my previous life. 
I’d also been her incredibly patient tutor since she was little, even as 
she’d used me as her personal punching bag. What was wrong with 
me seeing her as a child?
Sure, Eris had grown more and more mature of late, and not just 
in terms of how her body had developed. Slowly but surely, she had 
started to learn right from wrong. She rarely ever went on a rampage 
without thought for the consequences anymore. Her wild instincts 
hadn’t completely gone away, but the frequency of her outbursts 
had decreased. You could say she was in the process of going from a 
child to adult. Or so I liked to think, as if I were better than her, not 
that you could call me a shining example of an adult, even as a form 
of flattery. 
“Hmm…” 
Ruijerd quietly shut his eyes. “Ah well, it’s all right if you don’t 
understand.”
For some reason, I had a bad feeling about this. This felt an 
awful lot like the kinds of final conversations characters on TV had 
before they got killed off.
135    
“Mister Ruijerd.”
“What?”
“Please put this gold coin in your breast pocket,” I said, slipping 
one out of my own to toss toward him.
He looked bewildered. He didn’t have a pocket in his vest, after 
all. Still, he managed to successfully tuck it into a seam close to his 
breast. “All right, and what’s this for?”
“A good luck charm.”
Satisfied, I went to sleep.
   
A few days later, we finally reached the entrance to the Asura 
Kingdom: the Red Wyrm’s Lower Jaw. Four months had passed since 
we set out from the Shirone Kingdom. 
When things happened, they happened quickly. Specifically, bad 
things happened when you least expected them. In my old life, my 
parents had died suddenly. My siblings coming at me had been 
sudden, too. Paul had shipped me off to be a tutor without warning. 
Being transported to the Demon Continent had also been abrupt. 
There was something else I had yet to realize, and it was how 
harsh this world really was. How easily people died. No matter who a 
person was, death could come in an instant. There were no 
exceptions to that. 
It would take me a long time, but eventually, I would come to 
understand death as a phenomenon that abruptly robbed me of 
those closest to me. If I’d known this back then, I wouldn’t need to 
lament so deeply now. If only I’d been more serious about getting 
stronger—strong enough that I wouldn’t be defeated by anyone. 
136    
After what happened, I couldn’t but be consumed by regrets, wishing 
I’d walked a slightly different path.
There was one thing I could say, though. 
Eris never failed to impress me.
137    
The Red Wyrm’s Lower Jaw was a ravine with a path that 
cut directly through the mountains. The road wasn’t as straight as 
the Holy Sword Highway, but didn’t split or fork, either. It was a 
territory between country borders that was claimed by no one. Once 
we got through it, we’d be in the Asura Kingdom. 
We were in high spirits, sensing the end of our long journey. We 
were a bit concerned because we didn’t know how much our home 
had changed, but we were also starting to feel a sense of 
accomplishment. You could say that we let our guard down.
It was along that path that they came, walking steadily from the 
opposite direction. They weren’t riding horses, they weren’t sitting in 
a carriage; they were just walking. There was a man with silver hair 
and golden eyes who wore no real armor to speak of, only an 
unassuming white coat made out of some kind of leather. My 
impression of him was simply that he had a dangerous look in his 
eyes, and that was about it. His irises were small enough that you 
could see the whites all around them.
My eyes were more drawn to the other person, a young girl with 
black hair who followed behind him. Upon closer inspection, her hair 
was more of a dark brown shade, a slightly ashen color. I didn’t 
usually remember people by their hair color, but it shouldn’t have 
been hard to remember someone with pure black hair. Except I 
couldn’t recall anyone like that.
There was another reason this girl caught my eye. She had a 
mask pulled over her face. It was pure white with nothing drawn on 
it, a mask with absolutely no decoration. There was nothing 
particularly memorable about it, and yet if you saw it once, you’d 
never forget it. If I were to liken it to anything, it would be one of the 
138    
peel-off face masks from the world of my last life. Since it stood out 
so horribly, I doubted it was a fashion statement.
139    
140    
Since I was so captivated by this girl’s appearance—well, not 
that captivated—I didn’t notice Ruijerd sitting in the driver’s seat, his 
face white as a sheet. Eris was the same way. With each step the 
man took, bringing him closer, her face hardened and her grip on the 
hilt of her sword grew so tight that her hands turned white.
When the man noticed us, he gave a curious tilt of the head.
“Hm…? You…could you be a Superd?”
Doubt crept in when I saw his eyes, with their small irises, 
narrow. Ruijerd had shaved off all his hair and the jewel in his 
forehead was hidden. How did the man know? Did Ruijerd exude 
some kind of smell that gave him away? As I considered the 
possibility, I turned to look at Ruijerd.
“Is he an acquain…tance…?” My question was cut short by the 
look on Ruijerd’s face. His white skin was even paler than usual, 
beaded with cold sweat. His hand was trembling as he gripped his 
spear. That expression…I knew what that was.
Fear.
“Rudeus, whatever you do, don’t move. Eris, you either.” There 
was a tremor in Ruijerd’s voice.
I still had no idea what was going on, but I nodded wordlessly. 
Eris’ face flushed bright red and she looked like she might leap 
forward at any moment. Her arms and legs were trembling. Had the 
two of them met this man at some point, when I wasn’t aware of it? 
“Hm? That voice… You must be Ruijerd Superdia? I didn’t 
recognize you at first without your hair. What are you doing here?” 
The man casually approached us. Ruijerd readied the spear in 
his hand. On a whim, I decided to use my demon eye. 
“The man’s body splinters into multiple images.”
There were so many of them I couldn’t see the exact outline of 
his body. What the heck was going on?
141    
“Hm? The one with the red hair… Eris Boreas Greyrat, huh? And 
the other…who are you? Not a face I know… Oh, well. I see what’s 
going on, Ruijerd Superdia. You love children, so these two must be 
ones who were teleported to the Demon Continent during the 
incident. You brought them all the way here.” He had an all-knowing 
look on his face as he nodded.
Eris was shocked and shouted back, “H-how do you know my 
name?!”
I felt even more confused by her words. So this was the first 
time they’d met? I mean, this was Eris we were talking about, so it 
wouldn’t have been surprising if she’d simply forgotten. But this man 
wasn’t exactly forgettable, with his silver hair and the way the whites 
of his eyes showed around his irises. Then there was the matter of 
the abnormal reaction that he evoked in both Eris and Ruijerd. If 
she’d met him before, there was no way she would have forgotten.
“Who the hell are you?! And why do you know my name?!” 
Ruijerd thrust his spear out toward the man. Apparently, he didn’t 
know this guy, either. What the heck was going on…?
Ruijerd was famous. He wasn’t well-known on the Central 
Continent, but if you went to the Demon Continent, there were 
many who knew his name and his face. I wasn’t so sure about Eris, 
but if you’d heard her described as a young red-haired 
swordswoman, then you could make a rough guess as to who she 
was.
There was more to this strangeness. There was the man’s 
attitude…or rather, the difference between that and their reactions. 
He came across as friendly. His voice was flat, but—and I didn’t know 
where it stemmed from—there was a quality to it that made him 
sound happy, like he’d been reunited with old friends.
Ruijerd’s behavior was the complete opposite, acting as if he 
might attack at any moment. Except he hadn’t yet. He was treating 
142    
this man as an enemy, but he hadn’t launched an attack. Even Eris, 
who was always the first one to attack, hadn’t moved. And it wasn’t 
just because Ruijerd had told her not to.
“This is a curious place to meet you…but you seem well. That’s 
good.” The man stared at Ruijerd, who still had his spear pointed at 
him. Then he laughed in a self-deprecating way and took a step back.
Seeing that, the girl with the mask muttered, “Are you sure?”
“It’s unavoidable at this point.”
It was a conversation I couldn’t understand, lacking any context 
of what they were talking about. And once it was over…
“I’ll stay out of your way.” The man walked slowly over to the 
side. The black-haired woman followed him.
Ruijerd kept his eyes trained on the man. And of course, so did 
Eris. 
“You’ll know who I am…eventually,” the man said, his words 
measured and meaningful.
Intuitively I felt that this man knew something. I felt a vibe from 
this man that was the same as the Man-God’s. I had to get him to tell 
me what it was.
“Please, wait!” Before I realized it, I’d called the man to a halt.
He looked back, face etched with surprise. Ruijerd and Eris also 
looked at me with shock on their faces.
“What is it? What do you want?”
“Ah, greetings. My name is Rudeus Greyrat.”
“Never heard of you.”
Well, it was our first time meeting, after all.
“Wait, Greyrat, is it? What are your parents’ names?”
“Before we get to that, uh, what’s your name?” I asked.
“Hm… All right, I’ll tell you. I’m Orsted.”
143    
Orsted? Not a name I was familiar with. The only character with 
a similar name that I knew of was the one who died and kept 
spouting apologies from the other side. I glanced at Ruijerd and 
realized he didn’t seem to recognize the name, either. “Are the two 
of you acquainted?”
“No,” Orsted replied. “Not yet.”
“Not yet? What does that mean?”
“You don’t need to know. Now, who are your parents?” He 
coldly brushed me off.
He wouldn’t even answer my questions, and yet he expected me 
to answer his? Well, whatever. I wasn’t going to get upset over 
something that minor. “Paul Greyrat,” I said finally.
“…Hm? Paul shouldn’t have a son. He should have two 
daughters.”
Well that was rude. I was right here, looking just like my father. 
The idiot son who went all the way to the Demon Continent to make 
money.
“…Hm.” As if he’d realized something, Orsted tilted his head. 
Slowly he approached me.
“Don’t come any closer!” Ruijerd threatened him.
“Yes, I know.” He stopped, maintaining his distance, but stared 
right at my face. I matched his gaze. “You don’t turn your eyes away, 
huh?”
“I’d like to turn them away as soon as possible, since the look in 
yours is so terrifying,” I said.
“Hm, so that means you don’t feel any fear?” His brows 
furrowed. “Hmm. That’s strange. I have no memory of meeting you.”
Nor did I. This was our first meeting. I didn’t know the name 
Orsted, nor did I recognize his face. 
“So, what do you want?” he asked.
144    
“Um, well, I just thought maybe you knew something about the 
Displacement Incident.”
“I don’t.” He didn’t shake his head, but simply rejected the 
possibility outright.
Huh. Something about his attitude toward me was kind of 
weird. As if he were being cautious around me. As if he were being 
more distant with me than he’d been with either Ruijerd or Eris. 
Well, anyone would dislike being rudely stopped by someone only to 
be needled about this and that. Even if he did know something, I 
probably wasn’t going to get him to tell me about it.
“All right then, I’m sorry to have stopped—” 
It was exactly then, right as I was bowing my head in apology, 
that he said it. “You. Are you perhaps familiar with the name ‘ManGod’?” 
Finally, he’d said a word that I could understand.
Part of the problem was that I’d let my guard down, thinking 
that our conversation was already over. Another part was that I’d 
purposefully avoided saying anything about the Man-God to anyone, 
and now suddenly someone had spoken the god’s name, particularly 
a person who so thoroughly confused me. So, naturally, thinking that 
this was knowledge we both shared that would continue the 
conversation, I reacted to it without thinking.
I replied ever so casually, “I do. He’s appeared in my dream—” 
Suddenly, my vision changed.
“Orsted’s hand is going to spear right through my chest.”
It was so fast, as if he were teleporting. I couldn’t avoid it. A 
second was just far too short.
“Rudeus!”
The vision suddenly disappeared and Ruijerd wedged himself in 
front of me. He blocked Orsted’s attack and I was sent reeling 
145    
backward. Orsted peered over Ruijerd’s shoulder, glaring at me. His 
eyes were cold.
“So that’s it. You’re one of the Man-God’s apostles.”
In the same instant that I found myself thinking Orsted was 
making a false charge, Ruijerd was shouting at me, “Rudeus! Run!”
“You’re in the way, Ruijerd Superdia!”
Ruijerd swung his spear.
I couldn’t move. It wasn’t that I didn’t try to run, just that I 
didn’t even have a chance to try. Ruijerd was taken out in a matter of 
seconds. All I could do was watch as Orsted easily batted him away, 
much like a human swatting a fly.
Ruijerd was strong. At least, he was supposed to be. Even Eris 
hadn’t managed to defeat him once during our entire trip. He had 
five hundred years of experience in battle, which should have made 
him practically invincible. He should’ve been stronger than a King-tier 
swordsman. And yet, I could tell with my demon eye that he’d lost. 
Through the eye, I watched the whole thing from beginning to end. 
Time-wise, it probably only lasted all of ten seconds.
There was no way that Orsted was faster than Ruijerd. It was 
just that with every move Ruijerd made, he was at a slight 
disadvantage. In the span of a second, this was repeated three to 
four times. Each time he moved, he dug his grave deeper. Bit by bit, 
he was driven into a corner. Each time he tried to attack, his balance 
suffered slightly, and each attack he tried to launch was stalled. 
A difference in ability—that’s the only way I could describe it. 
Orsted’s skills just overwhelmingly surpassed Ruijerd’s. Enough that I 
could see it clearly with my eye.
Orsted was clearly drawing Ruijerd into a trap. He was moving 
as little as possible and yet at the fastest speed possible, rendering 
Ruijerd powerless. If a perfect combat strategy were made a reality, 
this was probably what it would look like. Orsted picked the perfect 
146    
intervals to move in, putting himself at just the right distance for 
Ruijerd’s spear to effectively reach him. It was as if Orsted were 
mocking Ruijerd, purposefully putting himself in a position to invite 
powerful consecutive attacks, only to throw him off balance, cause 
him to stagger, creating openings in his defense, and forcing Ruijerd 
to guard himself against heavy counterattacks.
There was nothing Ruijerd could do about this. There were no 
methods left to him. He took a fist to his solar plexus, then a second 
that grazed the tip of his chin. The third, which robbed him of his 
consciousness, was a fist that bore right down on his temple. Ruijerd 
rolled twice across the ground before he stopped moving entirely. 
Orsted could probably have killed Ruijerd on the third punch if he’d 
wanted to, but he didn’t. Even with someone as remarkable as 
Ruijerd as his opponent, Orsted was able to hold back.
“Now then.”
“Hyaaaah!” 
The one screaming wasn’t me. It was Eris. She leaped in front of 
me and whipped her blade toward Orsted, fast as an arc of light.
“Secret Technique: Flow.” Orsted wasted no time against Eris. 
All he did was gently stop her sword with the palm of his hand. At 
least, that was how it appeared to me. And yet, that was enough to 
send her spinning through the air. She flew as though she’d been hit 
with a Saint’s ultimate technique.
Eris had been outside his line of sight. As soon as Ruijerd was 
done in, she launched her attack from his blind spot. It was an 
incredibly deft offensive, as far as I could tell—she wasted no time 
thinking of defense, but jumped in to attack with everything she had. 
In return, Orsted had used only one technique of his own to disable 
her. 
147    
Wait. I’d seen something similar before. Paul had shown me 
something like that. It was a Water God Style technique, though 
Orsted’s execution was even more polished than Paul’s had been. 
“Aaah…!”
Eris crashed into a cliff face. Rocks crumbled from the impact, 
and she landed with a thud. She was incredibly tough, so I didn’t 
think she was dead, but she might have broken a bone.
“Eris Boreas Greyrat, you’ve honed your skills quite well. I 
believe you have potential, but…you’re still unpolished.”
“Ugh… uurgh…” Eris let out a groan and tried to get back up.
Normally, I’d heal her immediately at this point. However, I 
didn’t have the opportunity to try. After all, Orsted’s eyes were 
boring into me.
My companions were both defeated in mere moments. The 
whole time, I’d kept my demon eye activated, but all I could see, one 
second into the future, was despair. I saw that no matter what I did, 
he would do me in. I watched as my future self, just one second from 
now, had his vital points destroyed. My head, my throat, my heart, 
my lungs… I watched as each one of those were crushed, and at the 
same time, I had a vision of him just standing there, unmoving. I 
didn’t understand what was going on. If this vision was true, then in 
a second from now, there would be five of him.
I couldn’t move. I knew that no matter what I did, it was futile. 
That whole second passed with me unable to do anything. He slid 
forward, as if defying the laws of physics, and in an instant he was 
right before me. It was so sudden, like animation without enough 
frames.
In ths instant after he appeared before me, his attack was 
already over. I’d seen movements like this in some video game a long 
time ago. It was a post-apocalyptic game where every character had 
an endless combo or a Fatal KO.
148    
Six of my ribs were fractured simultaneously. There was an 
impact, but it was different from the kind that sent you flying. In the 
same instant, I felt the pressure of another attack hit me from 
behind. The damage accumulated inside my body. My lungs were 
crushed.
“Uughhh!” In a split-second, blood gushed up through my throat 
and I was vomiting red.
“It’s best to collapse a magician’s lungs,” he said nonchalantly as 
I sank to my knees.
I experienced an aha! moment of acceptance somewhere within 
me as I watched my lifeblood pool on the ground below. Crushing a 
magician’s lungs was the best course of action because then they 
couldn’t chant a spell. This meant I’d lost my ability to use healing 
magic. And of course, with my lungs destroyed, I couldn’t stay alive. 
“When you die, be sure to deliver a message to the Man-God for 
me. Tell him that the Dragon God Orsted will be the one to kill him.” 
The Dragon God. Number two on the list of the Seven Great Powers.
Orsted gave me a glance as I curled up on the ground, hands at 
my chest, and turned on his heel to leave. I realized he’d let his guard 
down. Since I’d already received a fatal wound, I hadn’t just been 
defeated—I was at death’s door. I didn’t know why, even in that 
state, I was still thinking about trying to fight back. Perhaps it was 
because, on the edge of my vision, I could see Eris trying to stand up. 
More likely, it was because I thought that now that this man was 
sure I was going to die, he was going to finish off the other two as 
well.
Regardless, I launched a stone cannon at him. Why didn’t I use 
more powerful magic? After all, I had Advanced-tier magic at my 
disposal if I wanted to use it. Even later, I never figured out the 
answer. In that moment, I was most likely just using the magic I was 
most familiar with.
149    
I launched the hardest rock I could, at the fastest speed with the 
quickest spin. That stone cannon was so powerful, even I was 
surprised. The rock burned red-hot as it flew the short distance from 
me to him.
“Orsted is going to look back and smash my stone cannon with 
his fist.”
And so he did. With the sound of clinking metal, it crumbled and 
fell to the ground in pieces.
Orsted look at his fist. “That was a stone cannon just now, 
wasn’t it? That had some incredible power to it. For you to be able to 
injure me with such magic is impressive.” The skin of his fist was 
peeled slightly. I’d barely grazed him.
It was no good. I couldn’t damage him with my stone cannon.
“I was sure I crushed your lungs, so you must be using voiceless 
magic? Is that a power you gained from the Man-God? What else did 
he give you?” Orsted stared at me. He could have just finished me 
off, but instead, he was watching me as if I were a grasshopper 
whose legs had been plucked off. 
“Ugh…!” I conjured wind magic to force air into my lungs. I 
choked violently. I knew there was no point to it, but I forced the air 
in anyway, filling my lungs, before I stopped breathing.
“An amusing use of magic. What purpose does that have right 
now? Why not use voiceless magic to heal your lungs?” Orsted put 
his hand to his chin, watching me as if he enjoyed seeing me suffer.
Even as my consciousness dimmed, I formed a ball of fire in my 
right hand. With fire magic, the more mana you poured in, the 
stronger the heat and the bigger it got. If my stone cannon’s speed 
and hardness didn’t work, then I would try heat and explosive power.
“That’s enough. Disturb Magic!”
150    
My feeble thoughts of resistance were easily blown away. The 
moment Orsted aimed his right hand at me, the mana that was 
beginning to take shape at the tip of mine was swept away. No 
matter how much I tried to channel mana into my hand, it took no 
form and dissipated. Even though I was half-conscious, I understood. 
There was interference with the mana in my hand that disrupted it 
and rendered my magic ineffective.
He had sealed my right hand, but I still had my left. So I lifted it 
and conjured magic between Orsted and myself, unleashing a 
shockwave. An explosive boom resounded as Orsted flew backward. 
I was also thrown away from the blast.
“Hmph…you nullified my Disturb Magic? No, that’s not it… 
You’re using multiple schools of magic simultaneously. Quite skilled 
to be able to do that voicelessly. Like this, was it?” The man snapped 
his fingers on his left hand. When he did, a small, square, fiftycentimeter window formed in the air. It was a beautiful window, 
adorned with gorgeous dragon-shaped ornaments. “Hm. More 
difficult than I expected.”
I ignored the window and focused on launching the fiercest fire 
attack against him that I could manage. What I pictured in my mind 
was an enormous flame. A mushroom cloud. A nuclear explosion. I 
channeled my magic as simply and straightforwardly as possible, as if 
powering up for a punch. I didn’t even think about the fact that Eris 
and Ruijerd might be caught up in it. I’d already lost the ability to 
think.
“Open, Front Wyrmgate!” As Orsted spat out the words, the 
window opened up.
In the same instant, the mana coalescing in my left hand was 
swallowed. The window frame cracked and splintered. An explosion 
was simultaneously triggered close to Orsted. It was far less powerful 
than I’d expected, and he easily avoided it.
151    
“What incredible mana capacity. A Front Wyrmgate at this size 
couldn’t contain it. It’s almost as if you’re on the same level as 
Laplace… Well, you are the Man-God’s apostle, after all. Why have 
you still not healed your lungs? Are you trying to lull me into letting 
my guard down?”
That was right before my consciousness cut out completely. I 
didn’t have the ability to discern what was happening anymore. 
The man was still observing me. Our eyes met. “Is that it?” In a 
split second, he closed in on me. There was nothing left I could do. 
“You can’t do anything besides magic?”
My magic was sealed, and my legs were frozen, so I couldn’t 
move. I was helpless in the face of his overwhelming murderous 
intent. In the edge of my vision, I could see the window pane 
dissipating, but there was nothing I could do.
“Guhugh!” I tried to use the roar I’d learned in the Doldia 
Village, the one that didn’t resemble theirs in the least. Orsted 
readied himself, but of course, all I was able to do was spit out blood 
to no effect.
“…Just mana? What are you trying to do?”
There was already nothing I could do. My magic was sealed, and 
nothing indicated I could beat him with physical attacks. The only 
thing I could do now was prostrate myself. But Orsted wouldn’t even 
allow me to do that. “Well, no matter. Die.” 
“Aagh…!” 
His hand speared right through my body at super-speed. 
Straight through my heart. An absolutely fatal wound. One my 
healing magic would be never be effective on.
“How disappointing, Man-God. Now you’re using pawns that 
can’t even coat themselves in a Battle Aura? Just what are you 
planning?” His hand was coated thickly in my blood when he 
extracted it. I tried to stand, but my body wouldn’t listen. It betrayed 
152    
me by crumbling to the ground. At the edge of my vision I could see 
Eris lifting her head, could see the stunned look on her face as she 
gazed over at me. Our eyes met.
“A-aah… R-Rudeu… Rudeus…!”
Ah, this sucks. I don’t want to die. I still hadn’t fulfilled my 
promise to Eris. Just two more years, I just wanted to hold on two 
more years. If I could do that, then I could die without reservations. 
Let me just gather my mana. It’s just one wound. I’ll heal it, I told 
myself. I couldn’t chant the words because there was a hole in my 
lungs. Still, I could do it. I just needed to slowly focus the mana. It 
would heal. It would heal. I couldn’t die yet.
“Waaaaaaaaaaaaah!” Eris let out a wail.
“Was he important to you? I’m sorry, Eris Boreas Greyrat. But 
one day you will understand. Let’s go, Nanahoshi.”
“Y-yes…”
Orsted slowly walked away, the girl following along behind him.
Eris couldn’t stand, either from the damage she took, or the 
fear. Or maybe the shock. All she could do was scream. She had no 
sword, so she used her voice.
“Ruijerd! Ghislaine! Grandfather! Father! Mother! Theresa! 
Paul! I don’t care who, just someone save him! Rudeus is going to 
die!”
Crap, my consciousness was fading further. Seriously? This was 
really the end?
But I didn’t…want to…die…
“Hey, Orsted, there’s just one thing that’s weighing on me. That 
boy… Wouldn’t it be better to just let him live?”
Just before my consciousness cut off completely, I felt like I 
heard someone say those words.
153    
Before I realized what was happening, I was in a 
completely white room. A completely white space where nothing 
existed. 
Normally, this was the point where I started to feel disgusted. I 
would return to being that hideous thing I’d gotten used to for thirtyfour years, and memories from my previous life would flash before 
me. Regret, conflict, vulgarity, and thoughts of entitlement. The 
memories I’d formed in the last twelve years would grow distant and 
dejection would well up. I would be consumed with the sense that I’d 
been caught in a long dream, and a sense of unease would fill my 
chest, as if chipping away at me.
This time, however, was different. The usual feelings of selfcontempt didn’t rise up. Instead, I experienced a sense of loss, as if I 
had a gaping hole in my chest. I looked down to find there was 
indeed a large opening there. Ah, I knew it. I really did die…
“Welp.”
The Man-God was standing there all of a sudden; I hadn’t 
noticed him before. He had his usual irritating smile on his face, but 
for some reason, it didn’t annoy me today. I wondered why. Maybe 
because of the hole that had opened up in my chest. Or maybe I’d 
decided earlier to stop being so hostile toward him.
“Well, what can I say, it’s unfortunate.”
Yes, it really is unfortunate.
“You’re different than usual. Are you okay? Not feeling good?”
As you can see, I’ve got a hole in my chest. Hey, do you mind if I 
ask you one thing?
“What is it?”
154    
That guy, the one named Orsted. He attacked me the second 
he heard your name. Why’s that?
“Because he’s a terrible Dragon God. Despite how virtuous I am, 
he holds great enmity toward me.”
Virtuous, huh…? Well, you are an easy one to hold enmity 
toward. But if that were the case, shouldn’t you have told me this 
beforehand? You can see all kinds of things, can’t you? You knew that 
I was going to run into Orsted then, right? If you had at least said 
something to me about not mentioning you if Orsted asked, I 
would’ve—
“No, sorry. The truth is I can’t see anything that has to do with 
the Dragon God. Not the future or the present. I had no idea you 
were going to run into him.”
Oh, so that’s it… But why?
“He’s got a curse on him that makes me unable to see him.”
Curse? So those actually do exist?
“Yes. You didn’t have them in your world? Someone who was 
born possessing an unusual power thanks to an abnormality 
triggered by mana?”
We don’t even have the concept of magic in the world I’m 
from. There were some who said they had the ability to sense the 
supernatural, but to be honest, they lacked any credibility.
“Aha, I see then. Well we have them here—Cursed Children we 
call them—odd ones. Orsted is one such example. Well, he’s got 
about three other curses as well.”
So four, huh? That is pretty incredible. Oh yeah, I’ve actually 
heard about that. Blessed Children and Cursed Children, was it?
“Yeah, that’s it. They’re the same thing, actually. Humans just 
like binaries.”
So that’s it. So, what kind of curses does he have?
155    
“Well, you saw how Ruijerd and Eris were terrified of him, right? 
That’s one of his curses. Every living thing in this world either hates 
or fears him.”
Everyone hates him? Well that’s…kind of unpleasant. My spirit 
would break instantly if that were me. I understand how it feels to be 
hated.
“Hold on, you don’t need to sympathize with him. He was born 
that way. He’s an evil being who’s trying to destroy the world.”
Come on, don’t say that. Anyone who was constantly 
surrounded by people who hated them would end up wanting to 
destroy the world. I had the same kind of thoughts in my previous 
life. I often grumbled about it on the Internet, saying how I wished 
everyone would just die.
“Hmm, you think so? I hate him, and I don’t really care how he 
feels.”
Hm? Does that mean you’re affected by the curse, too? The 
fact that you can’t see him is because of one of the curses placed on 
him? So he’s got a curse that makes him be hated, a curse where you 
can’t see him… What else?
“Who knows. I can’t see him, so I don’t know.”
Okay… But if he’s that dangerous, then it’s all the more reason 
I wish you’d told me that someone like that existed. 
“I never dreamed the two of you would ever meet. Walking 
about a world as vast as this one, the chances of running into him 
would be…”
Like finding a needle in a haystack, right? Come to think of it, I 
actually didn’t feel any hatred or fear toward him. Why is that?
“Isn’t that because you came from another world?”
So those from another world aren’t affected by the curse?
“That’s what it looks like. The same thing happened when you 
met Ruijerd, right?”
156    
…Huh? Hold up just a sec, what are you talking about? Is 
Ruijerd one of those Cursed Children, too?
“Nope, that’s just the curse of Laplace’s lance. Laplace also had 
a curse of fear on him, but he transferred it to his spear and passed it 
to the Superd tribe instead. He made their green hair the key to its 
effectiveness.”
Curse? He passed it off…? Hey, what’s going on? You knew 
about this from the beginning? You knew about it and that’s why you 
made him help him? You made me waste my time and effort?
“No, don’t get the wrong idea. The curse on the entire Superd 
tribe will gradually fade away with time. A bit of it remains with 
Ruijerd, but since he cut his hair, that immediately reduced its 
effectiveness.”
Now that you mention it, Sylphie was bulled about her hair, but 
I didn’t get the impression she was feared. That aside, why the hair? 
Because it’s the source of their mana?
“Because Laplace’s hair was also green.”
Ahh, now I get it. There was something similar to that in my 
world, too. Using points of commonality and wordplay to put curses 
on people or remove them.
“At any rate, thanks to his involvement with you, his curse is 
fading. There’s still a deep-rooted sense of discrimination that 
remains, but with time, and Ruijerd’s own efforts, maybe he can do 
something to change that.”
So it wasn’t a total waste after all? I’m glad to hear that, then. 
I guess you do put some thought into your actions.
“Well, it’ll be difficult for you to completely erase all the 
prejudice against the Superd.”
It is a complicated matter, after all. Still, yeah… At any rate, 
that’s great.
157    
“Yes, great indeed. Looks like it was worth introducing the two 
of you to each other.”
That’s the reason you introduced us? If that’s the case, 
shouldn’t you have just told me that?
“You had no intention of listening to what I had to say at first, 
did you? I didn’t get the chance.”
…Well, guess that’s true. I was pretty hostile when I turned you 
away. Can’t deny that. That aside, even Ruijerd was easily bested by 
Orsted. I never imagined he’d be that easily defeated.
“Given his opponent, of course Ruijerd would lose.”
Yeah, he is one of the Seven Great Powers, after all. How could 
you defeat him?
“You can’t.”
You can’t? I guess there really is that great of a difference in
ability?
“He’s the strongest person in this world, even as restricted as he 
is by all of those curses.”
The strongest? But the Dragon God is only second on the Seven 
Great Powers list! What about first?
“The Technique God is strong, too. But if Orsted actually went 
all-out, he’d be the victor. Orsted can use all of the skills and 
techniques that currently exist in this world, and on top of that, he 
can also use his own unique magic that’s specific to the Dragon 
God.”
All of the skills and techniques, huh? Sounds like a certain postapocalyptic savior I know.
“Oh? You have someone like that in your world too?”
They can copy all of the techniques of every opponent they’ve 
ever fought. Although they’re plenty strong even without that ability. 
Enough to destroy their opponent with the tip of one finger.
158    
“With just the tip of one finger? That is incredible. But so is 
Orsted. If he got serious, he could destroy this entire world.”
Just calling him strong seems a bit vague. How strong are we 
talking? Abnormally? Disastrously?
“Either way, he can’t unleash his real power thanks to a curse.”
So that’s the problem. Those curses sure are a pain. By the 
way, can I ask something?
“What is it?”
Just a second ago, you said you didn’t know about his curses, 
right? You said you didn’t know about them other than the one 
where he’s hated and the one where you can’t see anything to do 
with him, so why do you know that he can’t unleash his real power 
because of a curse?
“Uhh…”
It’s fine. This is the end, so let’s just get along. I won’t make a 
fuss, no matter what it is you’re hiding from me. I understand you 
cared about Ruijerd after all. And it was also thanks to you that Lilia 
and Aisha were saved. I’m not going to quibble over these little lies 
you’ve told. No matter what your plans were for me in the future, 
they ended up being short-lived, anyway.
To be honest, there’s a lot of other things I’d like to ask you, 
though. Such as why you introduced me to the Demon World’s 
Greatest Emperor and stuff. Or where some of the other missing 
people are located. Or what your real objective even is in the first 
place. All things that are a bit too late to be asking now.
Well, what can I say? We’re both failures, so let’s be friends. 
Let’s drop the formalities and have a blast together. We can dance 
naked, show our hidden talents, and of course, I don’t mind if we 
draw faces on our bellies to talk to each other, either.
“The end?”
Yes, this is the end. I mean, isn’t it? I died, after all.
159    
“Oh, I see. You’ve lost all hope and given up…the complete 
opposite of how you were when we first met, no?”
Back then, I died without knowing what the heck was going on. 
This time, well, there’s nothing I can do about it. Besides, I more or 
less knew that when I died, I’d wind up here. I have no idea where 
people go when they die, but I thought you’d come talk to me when it 
happened.
…Ah, looks like my consciousness here is fading. Looks like it’s 
about time for us to part ways. I’m glad we were able to have a calm 
conversation here at the end, at least.
“So that’s what this is about… Well, then I have good news for 
you.”
Hm?
“You’re not dead.”
Before I knew what was happening, the hole in my chest had 
disappeared.
   
Suddenly my eyes snapped open. Eris was right there—right 
before my eyes. I was lying on the ground, looking up at her. The 
back of my head felt warm, and I soon realized it was because she 
was cradling my head in her lap. Her face was full of anxiety as she 
gazed down at me, as if she were looking at something she didn’t 
want to see. But when I opened my eyes, relief shone visibly on her 
face. Her eyes were bright red. “R-Rudeus…you’re awake?!”
“Yea—blegh!” I tried to talk, but instead blood came out.
“Rudeus!” Eris wrapped her arms around me.
“Gghh…gack…!” I stopped coughing up blood, only to start 
choking violently.
160    
Eris stroked my back. “Are you okay?”
I saw the look of confusion on her face and tilted my head. 
“Why am I…alive…?”
The wound in my chest had closed up completely. Well, the 
word “completely” might have been a little misleading. There was a 
gaping hole in the center of my robe, and beneath it a scar, as if 
someone had welded me shut. Holy crap, this is weird, I thought. My 
right hand didn’t have an alien parasite attached to it, though.
“Just a moment ago when that girl said something, uh, Orsted or 
whatever his name was, used magic to heal you…” My question had 
been mostly rhetorical, but Eris incoherently fumbled out a response 
for me.
“Girl?”
“He called her Nanahoshi.”
Nanahoshi. That girl from before. Yes, I recalled that’s what 
Orsted called her. But hold on, Nanahoshi…? I felt like I’d heard that 
somewhere before. Sometime in the last year, no less. Where was it, 
though? I couldn’t recall.
“So he went out of his way to heal the person he’d just killed…?”
What was he thinking? I was sure he’d pierced my heart. Severe 
damage to an internal organ couldn’t be fixed with Intermediate 
healing magic. That meant he must have used Advanced-tier magic, 
or something even more powerful. Orsted must have possessed 
healing magic of such power that it could instantly save someone 
who had sustained a fatal injury. It seemed the Man-God hadn’t 
quite been lying when he said that Orsted could use any skill or 
technique in the world.
“I was utterly defeated.” 
Even if he was on a completely different level from me, it was 
still an accurate statement. He ranked second among the world’s 
161    
Seven Great Powers. According to the Man-God, he was actually the
strongest. Clearly, the title wasn’t just for show. 
“What about Ruijerd?”
“He hasn’t woken up yet.”
Upon further inspection, I realized Ruijerd was sleeping on the 
edge of the road. The carriage had also been pulled aside, and a fire 
was crackling. Had Eris done all of that by herself?
“This is the first time I’ve seen Ruijerd lying on his side like that,” 
I said.
“Rudeus, you shouldn’t talk yet. You were just choking up 
blood.”
“I’m fine now. Those were just dregs still left in my throat,” I 
said, even as my head remained in her lap. I didn’t want to move. I 
was going to stay here forever. 
I wondered what would happen if I flipped over and turned my 
face in a certain direction. In fact, that was the only thing I was 
thinking about. This was most likely part of humanity’s innate 
survival instinct. When faced with death, people wanted to leave 
behind offspring, after all. Ah well, whatever. Let’s not overthink 
complex matters. Let’s just dive in.
“Being alive is a wonderful thing,” I said as I spun my body 
around and wrapped my arms around Eris’ waist. I took a long, deep 
breath and her scent filled my nose.
“Rudeus…you’re awfully enthusiastic.”
“Hmm, I feel kind of like…everything just seems to be 
overflowing.” More than usual, anyway. No doubt because of that 
man, Orsted. Or because I’d had that dream with the Man-God. I’m 
repeating myself here, but there was no doubt that I’d felt unusually 
energetic since I woke up.
162    
“Then I’m fine to hit you, right?” There was a tremor in Eris’ 
voice as it floated toward me. An angry one, by the sound of it. Oh 
well, not like I could blame her. She’d been so worried for me, and 
I’d taken the opportunity to sexually harass her. I’d be pissed off in 
her position, too.
“Sure, go ahead.”
She punched me. Thud. 
Then she pulled me toward her chest and wrapped her arms 
tightly around my head. Her chest was soft against my cheek. I could 
hear the pounding of her heart deep within, and from above came 
the faint sound of her sobs. She was quietly crying. “Thank God…” 
she whispered.
I languidly reached up and patted her back.
163    
The three of us finally arrived in the Asura Kingdom three 
days later. It was right before us…or rather, we were right in it. 
Despite that, the events of the previous day still weighed us down, 
leaving glum looks on our faces. 
We’d been utterly defeated. We’d been wiped out so abruptly, 
and I’d even had my life taken from me. Orsted had resuscitated me 
on some strange whim, but if not for that, I wouldn’t even be here. 
That hadn’t quite sunk in yet. 
It was true that I’d thought I didn’t want to die when he landed 
his final blow. You’d expect me to be traumatized, and yet, when I 
opened my eyes, I felt refreshed. Well, that was a bit of an 
exaggeration. It was more like, oh, it was just a dream? It was the 
same feeling I got when I woke up from a nightmare. Perhaps 
because I’d seen the Man-God right as I was dying and so the whole 
thing felt surreal.
Put like that, it seemed the Man-God must have guessed what 
was going on and forced himself into my consciousness. To be 
honest, on an instinctive level, I wanted nothing more than to turn 
him away, but the Man-God did care about Ruijerd and his affairs, so 
maybe the god wasn’t actually that bad.
That aside, ever since I nearly died, Eris has been sticking really 
close to me while we were inside the carriage. Before, she’d just 
stand diagonally across from me and say, “I’m doing balancing 
training. Why don’t you give it a try?” But lately, she’d started sitting 
down. Specifically, right beside me. Close enough for our thighs to 
touch. Yesterday there was skin peeking out from the hem of her 
pants. It’s only human instinct to want to touch something you can 
see, so I reached out with my right hand, just a bit, and stroked it. In 
return Eris just glared at me, her face bright red.
164    
She didn’t punch me. Eris, the one who was always punching 
people, had suddenly stopped. Even when I did something that I 
totally deserved to be punched for, she didn’t. Her face would flush 
and she’d just glower at me instead. And she’d just keep doing that, 
staring me down. Not just that, but she’d keep sitting right next me. 
In the past, she’d move away when I did things like that, but now, 
she remained close.
To be completely honest, it was getting to the point where I 
wanted to thrust my hand into her pants next, so I wished she would 
put some distance between us. I knew there were some things you 
could pass off with a laugh and some things you couldn’t. I was 
holding myself back. But whether she knew of my internal conflict or 
not, Eris stayed close to me all the same.
If I left my hands unoccupied, they would wander off in Eris’ 
direction, so currently I was creating magic with my left hand and 
using my right to disturb the mana flowing out of it. This was the 
magic that Orsted had used. I believe he’d called it “Disturb Magic.” 
Just before the mana could take shape as it gathered in my hand, I 
used different mana to disrupt and disperse it. 
It was simple and didn’t cost much mana, yet it was an 
incredible technique. In retrospect, this method of nullification was 
similar to the King-tier barrier I’d gotten trapped in back in the 
Shirone Kingdom. It was simple to explain, but actually performing it 
was quite difficult. Perhaps because I was using my non-dominant 
hand to conjure with, for the most part the magic still took shape, 
albeit imperfectly. It was extremely difficult to completely nullify it 
the way Orsted had done. But it could still be used as a restraint, 
even in its imperfection. He’d actually taught me something pretty 
useful.
“Hey, Rudeus, what have you been doing this whole time?”
“I’m trying to mimic the magic that Orsted used,” I said.
165    
Eris stared intently at my hands. In my left, I’d crafted a small, 
misshapen stone cannon that fell to the floor with a small thud.
Another failure. I almost felt like I was playing rock-paperscissors with my hands. No matter how I tried, I kept letting my left 
hand win. Hm. This wasn’t going to work if I was being sloppy about 
it. In other words, there were some rules involved in disrupting 
magic. Did that mean that if I could unleash magic in accordance with 
those rules, I could actually nullify his Disturb Magic? The possibilities 
were growing.
“What kind of magic is it?”
“The kind that nullifies magic,” I answered.
“You can do that?”
“I’m practicing it right now.”
“Why are you doing something like that?” Eris asked.
“There’s been a number of times lately that I’ve had my magic 
sealed and couldn’t do anything. I guess you could say I’m 
researching. At the very least, if we ever meet Orsted again and it 
turns into a fight, I want to be able to get away from him. Make 
sense?”
Eris went quiet. For a short time, the only sound was of stone 
cannons thudding against the floor.
“Hey, Rudeus, how come you’re so strong?” 
Was I really strong? “I think you’re stronger than I am,” I told 
her.
“That’s not true at all.”
“…”
“…”
166    
The conversation died out. Eris looked like she had something 
she wanted to ask, but said nothing. I wondered what was on her 
mind, but I hadn’t the faintest idea. No, that wasn’t entirely true. 
“Are you worried about the fact that you were so easily 
defeated the other day?”
“…Yeah,” said Eris.
It wasn’t her fault. According to the Man-God, Orsted was the 
Dragon God, the strongest being in this world. He’d even easily 
dispensed with Ruijerd. It wasn’t a fair fight. He existed on a plane 
you couldn’t reach through effort alone. In my previous life, I’d put in 
a lot of effort in some areas and managed to scale some heights, but 
I’d never once ranked among the very top in anything. Even with the 
games I was engrossed in, where I thought there was no way I’d lose, 
there were always people better than I was.
Orsted had curses restricting him, and despite that, his physical 
fighting ability surpassed Ruijerd’s. He’d defeated Eris with one hand 
and rendered me completely powerless. On top of that, he fought in 
such a precise way that he exerted no more effort than necessary to 
take you from full HP to zero, which meant he still had energy to 
spare. I had no idea how strong he would really be if he went all-out. 
“He’s an unfair opponent to have. It’s not your fault.”
“But…”
I could understand why Eris was troubled. She’d been done in by 
one attack. He’d taken her sword attack straight-on and sent her 
flying.
“You’re still young. As long as you work hard, you’ll get 
stronger,” I assured her.
“You really think so…?”
“Yeah, even Ghislaine and Ruijerd said the same thing, didn’t 
they?”
167    
Eris suddenly lifted her head and looked straight at me. “You 
know you almost died, right? Why are you… How can you say that so 
easily?”
Well, because it felt surreal to me. I wasn’t thinking about trying 
to fight him in the future, either. The next time I saw his face, I was 
going to jet off like a rocket. Or maybe hide in the shadows like a rat. 
If I couldn’t find a way to run, maybe I’d beg him to spare my life. I 
prayed that wasn’t a sight that Eris had to see. 
“Because I don’t want to die next time,” I said finally.
“True, you don’t want to die, do you…?”
“Please don’t worry. I’m going to work hard, so that if we ever 
wind up in another dangerous situation like that, I’ll be able to pick 
you up and make a run for it.”
Eris had a complicated look on her face as she leaned her head 
against my shoulder. I might have gained more affection points with 
her if I’d used the opportunity to reach over and stroke her head, but 
I was in the middle of casting Disturb Magic with my right hand.
“Well, no matter what happens, we’ve got to get a little 
stronger.”
Just a little bit more. There was no way we were going to 
become the strongest in this world. The ceiling here was way too 
high. But I wanted to at least get strong enough that we could get 
away if we were attacked by some weirdo.
As I thought that, I pressed my face into Eris’ hair and inhaled 
her scent.
Once night fell and Eris was asleep, I spoke to Ruijerd. We’d 
spoken even less than usual since that incident. Ruijerd wasn’t much 
of a chatterbox to begin with, but since then he’d become morosely 
quiet. He probably blamed himself for what happened because, 
168    
despite his promise to deliver us safely home, he hadn’t been able to 
protect us. But at least I was still alive, regardless of how much luck 
played a part in that.
“That man, Orsted—he’s apparently the Dragon God,” I told 
him. “Number two of the Seven Great Powers.” I opened the 
conversation with that remark, starting on the idea that since our 
opponent was too strong, it was only natural that we lost.
“So that’s who he was. No wonder he was so…”
“Strong, right? After you were knocked out, there was nothing I 
could do to oppose him.”
“This is the first time since Laplace that I took just one glance at 
someone and felt like I couldn’t defeat them.”
Ruijerd didn’t know about the curses restricting Orsted’s power. 
He didn’t know he’d been beaten in physical combat by an opponent 
that was holding back. If he knew the truth, it might shock him.
“Even I don’t think I can stand against the elite of the Seven 
Great Powers. Those people are monsters beyond comprehension. It 
was bad luck that we ran into someone like that on the road. It can 
only be considered good luck that we managed to survive.” The 
words made it sound like he was making excuses, but it also felt like 
there was a tinge of self-reproach in Ruijerd’s tone. Perhaps he 
acknowledged that there was nothing he could do, but saw that as a 
separate matter from him being unable to fulfill his duty.
“Rudeus,” he continued. “If we ever meet someone like that 
again, you absolutely must not pick a fight with them. Don’t even 
meet their eyes. If you don’t want things to happen again like they 
did this time, that is.”
“Y-yeah. Well, next time I’ll probably just avert my eyes and 
move on.”
He was angry with me. Well, if I hadn’t called out to Orsted we 
probably would’ve just passed each other by. I would admit to that 
169    
mistake. Although he didn’t look that dangerous at first. No…after 
Ruijerd and Eris reacted the way they did toward him, I should have 
been more cautious.
“So then, what’s bothering you?” I asked.
Ruijerd cast a sharp glare at me. “Who is the ‘Man-God’?”
Oh. So that’s what this was about.
“At first, it seemed he intended to let us go. Despite the 
bloodthirsty aura radiating off of him, there was actually nothing 
murderous in his eyes. But the moment he heard the name ‘ManGod’ he turned all of that animosity toward you.”
I closed my eyes. Should I tell him or not? It was a decision I 
thought I’d already made before. But as unsavory as he looked, the 
Man-God wasn’t that bad a person, and after what had happened to 
us, I didn’t like keeping things hidden. 
“Actually, the Man-God is…” 
Despite how long I’d mulled over whether to tell Ruijerd or not, 
once I made my decision the words came right out, slipping past my 
lips. I told him how, since the time of the Displacement Incident, a 
mysterious being who called himself the Man-God had occasionally 
appeared in my dreams. That he’d advised me to help Ruijerd; that 
he’d given me advice at other times as well. That my suspicious 
behavior was because I was following that advice. Then I told him 
how it seemed that the Man-God and Dragon God were enemies. I 
told him that my conversations with the Man-God were vague and I 
was probably forgetting a lot of details, but I narrated it all as broadly 
as I could.
“The Man-God and the Dragon God…the Seven Gods of old… It’s 
all so sudden, it’s hard to believe,” said Ruijerd.
“I bet.”
170    
“But there are parts that make sense.” After he said that, 
Ruijerd went silent. The air was dominated by the crackling sound of 
the fire as it burned. The shadows it created danced around, etching 
themselves upon the face of one old warrior. Thanks to his genetics, 
Ruijerd looked quite young, but there was something in his 
expression that hinted at a battle-torn history.
Suddenly I remembered that, in my last dream, the Man-God 
and I had talked a bit about Ruijerd’s curse. “By the way, Mister 
Ruijerd. About the bad reputation of the Superd tribe…apparently, 
that’s a curse.”
“…What?”
“To be precise, it was a curse placed on Laplace, which he 
transferred to your spears, which then rubbed off onto the entire 
Superd tribe. Or so the Man-God said.”
“I see…so it’s a curse…” I’d shared that info with him thinking it 
would be good news, but Ruijerd just scowled and fell into thought. 
“I’ve never heard of transferring a curse before, but if it’s Laplace 
we’re talking about, it’s possible. He was able to do anything.”
I didn’t know much about curses, so Ruijerd was probably more 
knowledgeable about them than me. He seemed to consider it a 
while longer, but in the end, he just let out a weak laugh. “If it’s a 
curse, then there’s no way to fix it.”
“There isn’t?” I asked.
“No. They’re called curses because there’s no way to lift them. 
I’ve never heard of a curse that affects an entire tribe before, but…if 
that’s what a god said, then it’s probably true.”
He let out a laugh of self-derision, as if to say everything he’d 
done up until now had been for naught. It might have been just the 
lighting, but it seemed like there were tears at the edges of his eyes.
“But…” I started.
171    
“What is it?” 
“The Man-God said that unlike ordinary curses, this one is fading 
as time passes.”
“What?”
“He also said that it still remains in you, Mister Ruijerd, but 
you’ve severely reduced it by cutting your hair.”
“Are you serious?!” 
He shouted it so suddenly that Eris rolled over in her sleep, 
mumbling, “Mm…” This was probably a conversation I should have 
had with her as well, but… Oh well, I could do it again when she 
woke up.
“Yeah. He said that right now what remains is just traces of the 
curse and the initial prejudices that it created. The Superd tribe’s 
reputation can recover slowly but surely, depending on how hard 
you work from here on out.” 
“I see…that makes sense…”
“But that’s just what the Man-God said,” I added. “Even if you 
trust what he says, it might be best to take it with a grain of salt. We 
should continue to be as cautious we’ve been so far.”
“I know. Still, hearing that was enough for me.” Ruijerd went 
silent again. It wasn’t just the lighting that was making it appear that 
way anymore. He had tears streaming down his face.
“Well then, it’s about time I got to bed.”
“Yeah.”
I pretended not to see his tears. Our Ruijerd was a reliable 
warrior and a strong man who didn’t cry.
   
172    
A month passed after that. We didn’t visit the capital, but just 
followed a narrow route farther and farther north. We passed 
through many small farming villages, and saw wheat fields spread 
out before us and watermills off to the side as we continued on our 
way.
We didn’t gather information. We just headed north with as 
much speed as we could muster. We figured we’d catch up on 
everything once we reached the refugee camp, but even more 
importantly, we were almost there already. We just wanted to reach 
our destination as quickly as possible.
Finally, we arrived in the Fittoa Region, which was now empty. 
Even in places where there had once been traces of civilization, there 
was now nothing at all. There were no wheat fields, no fields of 
Vatirus flowers, no watermills, no livestock buildings. Grass was all 
that spread out before us—a field of it that stretched far and wide. 
The scene created a sense of emptiness, one that we cradled deep 
inside us as we arrived at the current (and only) city in the Fittoa 
Region: the refugee camp. Our final destination.
It was just before we reached the entrance that Ruijerd stopped 
the carriage.
“Hm? What’s wrong?”
Ruijerd descended from the driver’s seat. I looked around, 
thinking perhaps some monster had appeared, but saw no enemies. 
Ruijerd came to the back of the carriage and said, “This is where I 
take my leave.”
“What?” I raised my voice in shock at his sudden declaration.
Eris’ eyes also went wide. “W-wait just a second!” 
We nearly toppled out of the carriage as we stood to face 
Ruijerd. This was too fast. We’d just arrived at the refugee camp. No, 
173    
we were just a step away. “Can’t you at least rest a day—no, just 
walk into the town with us, at least?”
“Yeah, I mean—” Eris started.
“Unnecessary.” Ruijerd’s words were curt as he looked at us. 
“The two of you are both warriors now. You don’t need my 
protection.”
Eris went quiet when he said that. To be honest, I’d actually 
forgotten that the only reason Ruijerd had stuck with us this long
was to see us back to our home, and that once we’d arrived there, 
we’d be saying goodbye. I thought we’d always be together.
“Mister Ruijerd…” I started, then hesitated. If I tried to stop him, 
would he stay with us? In retrospect, I’d caused him enormous
trouble. It was true that he’d brought his share of problems with 
him, but I’d shown him far more of my pathetic weaknesses. Despite 
that, here he was acknowledging me as a warrior. I couldn’t ask any 
more of him.
“If you hadn’t been with us,” I said, “I’m sure we wouldn’t have 
made it this far in three years.”
“No, I’m sure you could have done it.”
“That’s not true. I’m too careless about some things, so we 
would have fallen afoul of something along the way, I think.”
“As long as you’re able to recognize that, you’re fine.”
There were numerous occasions on which I found myself at my 
wits’ end, such as when I was taken captive in Shirone. If Ruijerd 
hadn’t been with us, I would have probably panicked even further.
“…Rudeus, I told you this before.” Ruijerd’s face was even more 
calm than usual. “As a magician, you’ve already attained a kind of 
perfection. Despite all the talent you possess, you still don’t let it get 
to your head. You should be aware of how much it means to be able 
to do that at your age.”
174    
I felt conflicted about the meaning of those words. Even if he 
called me young, my actual age was over forty. The reason I hadn’t 
let things go to my head was because I still retained those memories. 
Although forty was probably still considered young as far as Ruijerd 
was concerned.
“I…” I paused as I started to speak. I could’ve rattled off a list of 
my weaknesses right there, but that seemed far too pathetic. I 
wanted to stand before this man with my head held high. “No, I 
understand. Mister Ruijerd, thank you for all you’ve done for us so 
far,” I said. I started to bow, only for him to grab me and stop me.
“Rudeus, don’t bow to me.”
“Why not…?” I asked.
“You may think that I’ve done a lot for you, but I think you’ve 
done a lot for me. Thanks to you, I see hope that my tribe can regain 
its honor once more.”
“I didn’t do anything. I basically wasn’t able to do anything.”
I’d tried to turn the name “Dead End” into something positive 
on the Demon Continent, but we were never anything more than a 
group of adventurers while we were there. In the Millis Continent, 
that name just didn’t carry the same weight. I’d meant to come up 
with a new strategy, but it just kept getting pushed back, and then 
we’d come to the Central Continent and I wasn’t able to do anything 
else to help him. I liked to think everything we’d done had some 
impact, but I couldn’t erase the sizeable history of oppression in the 
world, and I couldn’t do anything about the prejudices people held 
toward the Superd tribe.
“No, you did a lot. You taught me that my straightforward 
method of saving children wasn’t the only one out there.”
“But none of my methods were very effective,” I countered.
“Still, I’ve changed. I remember all of it. The words of that old 
woman in Rikarisu City who, thanks to your schemes, said she didn’t 
175    
find the Superd tribe scary. The looks on those adventurers’ faces 
when they heard the name ‘Dead End’—how they weren’t 
frightened, but rather laughed cheerfully. The closeness I felt to the 
warriors of the Doldia tribe and how they accepted me even after I 
told them I was a Superd. And the Shirone soldiers, and how they 
cried as they thanked me when they were reunited with their 
families.” 
The first two aside, the rest happened through Ruijerd’s own 
efforts. I hadn’t done anything. “Those were things you did by 
yourself,” I told him.
“No. I couldn’t do anything by myself. In the four hundred years 
since the war I worked alone, unable to take a single step forward. 
The one who showed me that step was you, Rudeus.”
“But that really happened because of the Man-God’s advice.”
“I don’t care about some god I’ve never seen. The person who 
really helped me was you. No matter what you think, I feel a debt of 
gratitude toward you. That’s why I don’t want you to lower your 
head to me. The two of us are equals. If you want to thank me, look 
me in the eyes,” Ruijerd said as he stretched an arm out toward me.
I looked him in the eyes as I reached out and gripped his hand in 
mine.
“I’ll say it again. Thank you, Rudeus, for all you did for me.”
“And the same to you. Thank you for everything you did for us.” 
When I squeezed his hand, I felt the strength coming from him. 
The corners of my eyes started to sting. Ruijerd had accepted 
someone like me—someone who was pathetic, who’d failed the 
entire way. 
After a few moments, he pulled his hand away, and rested it on 
top of Eris’ head. “Eris,” he said.
“…What?”
176    
“Can I treat you as a child this one last time?”
“Fine, whatever,” she answered curtly.
There was a faint smile on Ruijerd’s face as he stroked her head. 
“Eris, you have talent. Enough to become far, far stronger than me.”
“Liar. After all, I lost to…” Her mouth curled downward into a 
pout.
Ruijerd chuckled and said the same words he’d always used 
when they practiced. “You survived an attack in battle from a man 
who bears the name of a god. You…” Understand what that means, 
right?
She glared at him sharply. Then at last her eyes widened with 
realization. “…I understand.”
“Good girl.” Ruijerd patted her on the head before dropping his 
hand.
Eris kept the tight frown on her face and balled her hands into 
fists. It looked like she was trying her best to hold in her tears. I 
turned my gaze away from her and asked Ruijerd, “What are you 
going to do after this?”
“I don’t know. For now, I intend to look for any remnants of the 
Superd tribe on the Central Continent. Restoring honor to my tribe is 
just a dream within a dream if I’m all by myself.”
“All right then. Good luck. If I have any free time, I’ll see if I can 
do something to help out, too.”
“…Heh. And if I have any free time, I’ll see about looking for your 
mother,” Ruijerd said as he turned away. He didn’t need to prepare 
for his journey. He could make his way even if he set out with just 
the clothes on his back. 
Yet he suddenly stopped and turned back. “That reminds me, I 
need to return this.” Ruijerd removed the pendant that was hanging 
from around his neck. It was the Migurd tribe pendant I’d received 
177    
from Roxy. It was the only item that tied Roxy and me together…at 
least, it had been.
“Please keep that with you,” I told him.
“Are you sure? Isn’t it important to you?”
“That’s exactly why I want you to keep it.”
When I said that, he nodded. It seemed he was willing to take it. 
“All right then, Rudeus, Eris…let’s meet again,” Ruijerd said as he left 
the two of us. 
We’d spent so much time talking about things when he first said 
he’d come with us in the beginning, and yet now, as he was leaving, 
everything seemed to be happening in an instant. There was so much 
I wanted to say to him. So many things had happened, from the time 
we met on the Demon Continent until we reached the Asura 
Kingdom. So many feelings that words couldn’t even describe. Like 
not wanting to say goodbye to our companion.
“Let’s meet again.”
All those feelings were wrapped up in those few words as his 
silhouette receded into the distance. That’s right—we just have to 
meet again, I told myself. We surely would. As long as we were still 
alive, we’d definitely meet again.
Eris and I watched Ruijerd go, in silence and with gratitude for 
everything he’d done for us up until now, until he faded away 
completely.
That was how our journey reached its conclusion.
178    
179    
The refugee camp was quiet, and the size of a village. If 
this were the Demon Continent, it would be just large enough to be 
considered a city, but it had no life to it. Silence permeated the air, 
and the camp’s occupants were few relative to its size. I could sense 
people within the hurriedly constructed log houses, so the place was 
definitely inhabited, but there was no spirit left in its residents. 
I headed into the middle of the refugee camp, where a building 
that resembled an Adventurers’ Guild stood. This was the 
headquarters of the refugee camp, according to the note that was 
written on the entrance. When I went in, I found it was just as 
melancholy. 
I had a bad feeling about this.
“Rudeus, that’s…” Eris pointed at a sheet of paper. At the very 
top of the page was the name “Fittoa Liege Lord James Boreas 
Greyrat,” and beside it, “Seeking Status Information, Deceased or 
Missing.” Beneath that were the names of those who’d gone missing 
after the incident, listed alphabetically by village and city. 
“Let’s look at that later,” I said.
“Yeah.”
The list of the deceased was incredibly long. Also, the Liege Lord 
named at the head of the document wasn’t Sauros. Both of those 
things made me anxious as we headed deeper within the building.
When we gave Eris’ name at the counter, the middle-aged 
woman attending it quickly slipped into the back. Then she returned, 
happily, with a man and woman in tow. Their faces were familiar. 
One of them was bearded and white-haired, wearing an outfit that 
looked slightly finer than that of an ordinary townsperson. It was 
180    
Alphonse, the household butler. The other had chocolate-colored 
skin and was wearing a swordsman’s outfit.
“Ghislaine!” Eris had a look of pure joy on her face as she raced 
over to the woman. If she had a tail, it would be wagging.
I was happy, too. I hadn’t heard any news of Ghislaine this 
whole time, but she looked well. Perhaps the reason Paul hadn’t 
heard anything about her was just a gap in the information stream.
Ghislaine looked at Eris’ face and broke into a wide grin. “Eris, 
no, Lady Eris, I’m glad you made it safely—”
“…It’s fine, you can just call me Eris.”
Ghislaine looked happy for a moment, but soon enough, her 
expression clouded over. Even Alphonse was gazing at her 
sympathetically. It can’t be… I thought as a sense of unease welled 
up within me.
“Eris…let’s talk further in.” Ghislaine’s voice was hard. Her tail 
was standing straight up. Her expression wasn’t that of someone 
who was simply happy at Eris’ return. She was nervous.
“Yeah, okay.” Eris saw the look on Ghislaine’s face and seemed 
to understand. She followed Ghislaine deeper into the building.
When I tried to follow them, Alphonse stopped me and said, 
“Master Rudeus, please wait outside.”
“Huh? Oh, okay.” It made sense, I guessed. I was honestly just 
hired help, so perhaps I wasn’t allowed to listen in on important 
conversations.
“No, Rudeus will come too,” Eris said in a strident tone, one that 
would brook no dissent.
“If that is what you wish, Lady Eris.”
Eris’ lips were pulled together even tighter than usual, her hands 
curled so hard at her sides they were turning white.
181    
We silently passed through a short hallway and entered what 
looked like a workroom. There was a sofa in the middle, and a vase 
at the edge of the room which contained a Vatirus flower. The far 
end of the room was furnished plainly and contained only a cheaplooking work desk.
Eris didn’t wait for an invitation before taking her seat on the 
sofa. She grasped my hand and dragged me along to sit beside her. 
Ghislaine, as usual, took up her position at the edge of the room. 
Alphonse stood in front of Eris and bowed to her in the traditional 
way of a butler.
“Welcome home, Lady Eris. I received word earlier you would be 
making your way here and waited patiently for your—”
“Cut the courtesies and just say it. Who died?” Eris interjected. 
She asked the question outright, without any padding to cushion the 
harshness of the words. She sat straight-backed, with strength in her 
gaze, but I knew there was anxiety swirling in her heart. Mostly 
because she was squeezing my hand so tightly.
“About that…” Alphonse’s response was evasive.
Judging by his manner, Sauros was likely dead. Eris was a 
grandpa’s girl. She mimicked every single one of his mannerisms. If 
he was dead, it would hurt her greatly.
Alphonse forced the words out with great effort. “Lord Sauros, 
Lord Philip, and Lady Hilda… All three of them are deceased.”
The second we heard those words, her fingers crushed my hand. 
Pain shot up my arm, but it was Alphonse’s words, rather than the 
pain, that left me dazed. It had to be a mistake, right? It hadn’t been 
that long. It hadn’t even been three years yet. Or perhaps it’d be 
more correct to say it would soon be three whole years.
“There’s…no mistake about that, right?” There was a tremor in 
Eris’ voice when she asked the question.
182    
Alphonse nodded. “Lord Philip and Lady Hilda were teleported 
together and passed away in the Conflict Zone. Ghislaine confirmed 
this.”
Ghislaine bobbed her head.
“That’s right… Where was Ghislaine teleported to?”
“The same place as Lord Philip. The Conflict Zone.” Ghislaine 
said succinctly. 
As she was pushing through the Conflict Zone on foot, she’d 
happened upon Philip and Hilda’s bodies. That was all she said. She 
didn’t explain what condition their remains were in or how exactly 
she’d found them, but judging by the look on her face, it was bad. 
Was it the condition of the bodies or the way in which they died? Or 
had she seen something that made her want to turn away? Had she 
heard something that made her want to cover her ears?
Eris just made a single humming sound, but her hand was 
trembling as it gripped mine. “And what about my grandfather?”
“…He was forced to take responsibility for Fittoa’s Displacement 
Incident, and was executed.”
“That’s absurd,” I blurted out without thinking. “What meaning 
would there be in executing Lord Sauros?” 
He was forced to take responsibility for a natural disaster, and 
executed? That was ridiculous. There was nothing he could’ve done 
about it. Or did they expect him to stop it before it happened? It had 
happened suddenly and without forewarning. What responsibility 
was there to be had?
“Rudeus, sit.”
“…”
Eris tugged at my hand and forced me back into my seat. 
Apparently, at some point, I’d stood up. There were feelings pooling 
183    
around inside my head that I couldn’t express in words. Perhaps it 
was the extreme pain that made them incoherent. My hand hurt.
No. In truth, I understood. Even if there was no forewarning, 
even if it couldn’t have been prevented, people had died. Fields and 
crops had disappeared. The losses were immeasurable. The people 
were steeped in discontent and they needed a scapegoat. Even in my 
previous life in Japan, the Prime Minister would take responsibility 
by immediately resigning if something shameful happened.
By dying, Sauros had taken the people’s discontent with him. 
Someone capable could take his place. At least then, people might
find some relief. 
It wasn’t just that, though. I was sure that some power struggle 
between the nobles was involved. I had no idea just how much the 
old man Sauros had possessed in terms of authority, but it must’ve 
been enough for his downfall to warrant being killed.
I could rationalize it. I could. But then, that just brought us to 
our current situation. To a refugee camp blanketed in silence. To a 
practically deserted headquarters. There were no signs that the 
country was serious about reestablishing the Fittoa Region. If Sauros 
were still alive, perhaps he would’ve taken more active measures. 
That old man was useful precisely in these kinds of situations.
But no—that was only a front. Eris’ feelings were what I cared 
about. I couldn’t stay calm when I thought about how she must be 
feeling to hear she had no family left. I had no idea when Philip and 
Hilda’s deaths were reported. It could have been before or after
Sauros’ death. But Sauros at least had been alive—“had” being the 
keyword. There’d been no need to kill him.
Just how many did they think had died in this disaster—in the 
Displacement Incident? Hundreds of thousands, an uncountable 
number, and yet they purposefully killed a man who had returned 
alive? Eris had come all this way to return home just to learn that?
184    
Ah, crap. I couldn’t think straight. My hand hurt.
“Master Rudeus, I understand how you feel, but…this is the 
current state of the Asura Kingdom.”
Alphonse, the master you served was killed! Ghislaine, the man 
who saved your life was killed! I thought. Those were the things I 
wanted to say to them.
Yet…nothing came out.
Mostly because Eris didn’t say anything. There was no point in 
me shouting and crying. Even though they’d taken care of me, and 
we were related, Sauros had still been a stranger to me. If his family 
wasn’t going to say anything, what point was there in me 
complaining?
“…So, what am I supposed to do?” In an uncharacteristic show 
of quietness, Eris neither lashed out nor yelled.
“Lord Pilemon Notos Greyrat has said he would welcome you as 
his concubine, Lady Eris.”
Even I could feel the murderous intent suddenly pouring out of 
Ghislaine. “Alphonse, you bastard! Do you seriously intend for her to 
take that offer?!” she howled at him, so viciously I thought she might 
split my eardrums open. “I’m sure you remember what he said!” 
Alphonse retained his cool even in the face of Ghislaine’s fury. 
“Even so, if we’re to think of the future of the Fittoa Region, a bit of 
discomfort is—”
“As if she could ever be happy being married to a man like that!”
“He’s filth, but he has a distinguished family name. There are 
many undesired marriages that result in happiness,” Alphonse said.
“I don’t care how many! Are you even thinking about Eris at 
all?!”
“I’m thinking about the Boreas family and the Fittoa Region.”
“So you plan to sacrifice Eris for that?!” Ghislaine barked back.
185    
“If it’s necessary.”
I watched in mute amazement as the two of them suddenly 
broke into an argument. Eris stood before I realized what was 
happening. She let go of my hand and folded both arms over her 
chest, her legs spread wide beneath her and her chin tilted forward. 
“Enough!” 
Her voice was loud enough that Ghislaine had to cover her ears. 
This was the full extent of Eris’ bellow—one I hadn’t heard lately. 
However, that was all the energy she seemed to have. 
“Just…leave me by myself. I want to think.” The two of them 
looked shocked when they heard how disheartened her voice 
sounded.
Alphonse was the first to leave. Ghislaine looked reluctant as 
she gazed over at Eris, but left. 
Then it was just me.
“Eris…um…”
“Rudeus, did you not hear me? Leave me alone for now.” Her 
tone left no room for argument.
I felt a bit shocked. This was probably the first time in a few 
years that Eris had pushed me away like this.
“Okay, I…understand.” My shoulders drooped as I watched Eris 
turn her back toward me. The second I left the room and closed the 
doors, I swore I could hear a sob.
   
Alphonse had prepared rooms for us. There were four of them, 
narrow and located in a house near the headquarters, probably 
intended for the refugees. I carried my luggage into one of them and 
186    
stowed Eris’ in the room neighboring mine. I changed out of my 
travel clothes and into ones for going around town. I discarded my 
misshapen, patched-up robe on the bed and left the room.
I returned to the headquarters. I wanted to try talking to 
Alphonse and Ghislaine some more, but I didn’t see them. I didn’t 
have the willpower to search for them, so I gazed at the notice board 
instead. Paul’s message was pinned there, the one I’d seen 
numerous times in the past few months. Search the Central 
Continent or the northern region, it said. Written when I was still 
about, what, ten years of age? I’d soon be thirteen. Time sure had 
passed quickly.
My eyes scanned over the list of dead and missing. They landed 
on the section titled “Buena Village.” The names of people I knew 
were listed in a row on the missing persons list. Over half had a line 
slashed through them. A glimpse at the column of the dead revealed 
that the same names had been written over there. Apparently, as 
their deaths had been confirmed, their names were crossed out and 
they were added to the list of dead. There were slightly more names 
in the missing column than the dead, but the list of dead were 
densely packed together. 
I saw Laws’ name written in the missing persons column with a 
line run through it, and my brows furrowed. I’d heard from Paul that 
Laws was dead. I hadn’t heard the details of how he died, though. 
Then, just below that, I saw it. There, in the missing persons 
column, was Sylphie’s name. And a line was drawn through it. 
Ba-thump. My heart drummed loudly.
It can’t be, I thought as I looked at the column of the dead. I 
didn’t see her name near Laws’. I started at the top and scanned 
down to the end, but her name wasn’t there at all.
“Um, this, there’s a line drawn through this name, but it’s not in 
the list of the dead…?” I asked one of the staff, voicing my doubt.
187    
“Yes, that’s one of the people who was confirmed to be a 
survivor.”
When I heard those words, something inside my chest dropped 
with a thud. It was like my heart had fallen straight through my 
stomach and right through my guts. That’s how relieved I felt at the 
revelation that Sylphie was alive.
“Then do you also know how to contact them?” I asked.
“If that person hasn’t come to our headquarters here 
themselves, then I’m afraid not.”
“Could you check for me? The name is Sylphiette.”
“Please wait just a moment.”
It took some twenty minutes or so as the staff searched.
“I’m sorry, but her contact information hasn’t been registered 
with us.”
“Oh, All right…”
There were two possibilities, then. Either she hadn’t settled 
down yet and so she had no contact information to list, or someone 
else had spotted her and updated the list, so her contact information 
hadn’t been recorded. There was the possibility that there’d been 
some mistake, but I didn’t think that was it. There was an extremely 
high possibility that Sylphie had survived. For the moment, I should 
just be happy about that. 
Of course, I was worried, too. About her hair color, for instance. 
It was a slightly different shade than that of the Superd’s, but it was 
still the same general color. According to the Man-God, the curse 
was one that applied only to the Superd tribe. Still, there were many 
cruel people out there in the world. She might be out there 
somewhere, crying because of a comment made about her hair… 
No. Paul had said that she could use healing magic without the 
need for incantations. That meant she had enough strength to 
188    
survive on her own. Perhaps she was just like me, working as an 
adventurer. Perhaps she was searching for her family, unaware that 
they’d already passed away. In fact, if she’d survived the incident, 
that was probably the most likely possibility. I just prayed she hadn’t 
become a slave or anything.
For the moment, I took it upon myself to cross Lilia’s and Aisha’s 
names off the missing list. There was already a line through my 
name. They had heard that Eris was on her way here, so they 
probably knew about me as well. 
Among Paul’s family, the only name that remained was Zenith 
Greyrat, meaning she still hadn’t been found, after all. Perhaps I’d 
ask the Man-God the next time he appeared in my dreams.
When I finished looking over the bulletin board, Eris still hadn’t 
come out of the room. She was normally so quick to recover. This 
was the first time I’d seen her this troubled over something. But we’d 
journeyed so far to get here, and now that she’d arrived home, there 
was no family or warm house to welcome her. Perhaps that was 
enough to overwhelm even someone as strong as Eris.
Maybe I should go back and comfort her after all, I thought. 
No, let’s wait a little bit longer. 
I decided to return to the building where I’d left our luggage. I 
figured I’d find something to preoccupy myself, though I didn’t have 
any ideas as to what. Perhaps I’d just rest a little instead.
   
Alphonse called to me as I moved to leave. He brought me to a 
room located in the refugee camp’s headquarters and took a seat in 
front of me. To my right sat Ghislaine. The only reason the two of 
189    
them were sitting was probably because Eris wasn’t with us. Unlike 
me, they seemed to understand the master/servant hierarchy.
“Now then, Master Rudeus, please provide a concise report.”
“A report?”
“Yes, as to what you have been doing these past three years.”
“Oh, yeah, all right.” 
I told him how we’d been transported to the Demon Continent 
and met Ruijerd. How we registered as adventurers and used that to 
bring in daily income as we moved from place to place. I told him 
about the incident in the Great Forest. Then I told him how we met 
Paul and his Fittoa Search and Rescue Team, and how that was the 
first we’d learned of the situation back home. I told him how we 
headed north while searching for information, and about the events 
that transpired in the Shirone Kingdom. I tried to be as concise as 
possible, keeping the conversation centered around Eris.
Alphonse listened in quietly, but when I told him about how 
we’d parted with Ruijerd, he spoke up. “The man who escorted you 
returned home?”
“Yes, he really looked out for us.”
“Truly? Once things settle down, I’d like to propose to Eris that 
we officially reward him for his assistance.”
“He’s not the type of person who would accept something like 
that.”
“Is that right?” Alphonse nodded and quietly glanced over at 
me. His eyes were those of an exhausted man. “Well, Master 
Rudeus…of those who served Lord Sauros, it is only the three of us 
who remain.”
“What about the other maids?” I asked.
“Judging by the fact that they haven’t returned, they’re either 
dead or they’ve returned to their homeland.”
190    
“Oh, all right.” So even the cat-eared girls were wiped out? Or 
perhaps some of them returned to their home in the Great Forest. 
“And the lord took such good care of them, too. How dreadful.”
“It was ultimately nothing more than a financial relationship to 
them, I assume.” When I said that, Alphonse’s poker face cracked 
slightly. My words might have been a tad harsh, but I was sure they 
were true.
“Because of your youth, I hesitated over whether or not to 
include you in this conversation. But if you can retort like that, I’m 
sure you’re more than capable. You protected Lady Eris and 
delivered her here safely. As a way to recognize your achievements, 
we welcome you as vassal to the Boreas Greyrat family.”
A vassal? So that’s what this gathering was?
“Henceforth, I will be conducting this as a meeting between 
vassals. You take no issue with this, I presume?”
A meeting? I was sure they’d probably conducted these 
meetings even before I was sent to tutor Eris. I was also sure that 
Ghislaine hadn’t been included back then. There were only three of 
us right now, but many vassals had undoubtedly gathered for such 
discussions in the past.
“Thank you. What is the topic at hand?” I had no intention of 
engaging in idle banter, so I cut to the chase. Besides, Philip and 
Sauros were no longer here. It was obvious who we were going to be 
talking about.
“It’s about Lady Eris.”
See? Just what I said.
“Specifically, I’d like to talk about her future.”
“Her future?” I echoed.
191    
Eris had returned to her homeland, but there was nothing here. 
She had no family and no household. She couldn’t return to the life 
she’d enjoyed before.
“While it’s true that Lord Sauros and Lord Philip have passed, 
the Boreas family itself hasn’t been completely destroyed, correct? 
They can at least prepare a place for her to live in, right?” I asked.
“Lord James would be concerned about rumors. I think it likely 
he would refuse to take Lady Eris into his household.”
James… In other words, Eris’ uncle, right? The current Liege 
Lord. If he cared that much about what people thought, then he 
probably wouldn’t want someone like Eris around. Her manners 
were a bit iffy, and she didn’t exactly fit one’s image of a noble lady. 
James was also supposedly sheltering Eris’ brothers, and most likely 
a number of cousins as well. It wasn’t difficult to imagine Eris causing 
strife with one or more of them. 
“Even if he were willing to take her in, it’s doubtful whether the 
other nobles would accept her as one of them. I can’t picture her 
taking on the duties of a maid, either. Therefore, I’m going to reject 
the idea entirely.”
I nodded at his words. He was right. Even though Eris had 
mellowed a bit, her wild disposition was the same as ever. 
“Next, I’d like to discuss the invitation from Pilemon Notos 
Greyrat. He said that when Eris returned home, if she had no other 
place to go, he would be willing to welcome her as one of his 
concubines.”
Pilemon—my uncle and Paul’s younger brother. He was the 
current head of the Notos household. I’d gotten the sense old man 
Sauros didn’t like him at all. 
When I glanced at Ghislaine, I saw she had her brows knit and 
her eyes closed.
192    
“It’s not a bad option,” Alphonse said. “But there are some 
troubling rumors about him.”
“Troubling rumors?” I asked.
“Yes, about him trying to curry favor with High Minister Darius, 
who has rapidly been gaining political power as of late.”
Why was that troubling? Wasn’t it normal for powerful people 
to curry favor with those who possessed more influence than them?
“Lord Darius has been gaining power for the past few decades, 
and supports the First Prince’s ascension to the throne. He’s also 
primarily responsible for driving the Second Princess out of the 
country.”
I have no idea what you’re talking about when you suddenly 
bring up First-this and Second-that, I thought. 
“Lord Pilemon was once amongst a group of those supporting 
the Second Princess, but…”
“But when she was driven out of the country, his group lost all 
of its power?” I guessed.
“Precisely.”
In other words, the big boss on his side lost and now he was 
scheming to try to switch over to the winning team. “I don’t see the 
problem,” I said.
“Lord Rudeus, do you remember that kidnapping incident from 
some time ago?”
“Kidnapping incident?”
“The one where actual kidnappers seized Lady Eris.”
The kidnapping plan I’d proposed, then.
“The one behind that crime was Lord Darius,” Alphonse said.
“…Hm.”
193    
“Lord Darius has only been to the Fittoa Region once, and in that 
time, it took just one glance for him to take a deep interest in Lady 
Eris.”
“You mean in a sexual sense?” I asked.
“Of course.”
So, the truth was revealed after all these years. No—he’d 
probably been identified as the culprit even back then, but they 
couldn’t afford to kick up a fuss because of how powerful he was.
I wondered why Sauros had refused to let him have Eris. Was it 
because he hated Darius? The old man had been the type to let his 
personal feelings dictate his actions. Well, whatever the basis for his 
decision, it didn’t matter much now.
“If Lord Pilemon were to take Lady Eris as his concubine, he 
would probably find some excuse to offer her to Lord Darius.”
Hmm, so Darius had been the perverted noble all this time. 
Apparently, there were a lot of those in the Asura Kingdom. Granted, 
he had good taste if he fancied Eris, though that taste was the only 
non-terrible thing about him.
“Well, we’re rejecting that idea, right?”
“Not quite. While I can’t help but grimace at the idea of the man 
himself, Lord Darius has the most influence in the capital right now. 
Lady Eris won’t like him, but it would guarantee her status and the 
comfort of her living conditions.”
“But still…”
“And if she were to make a bit of a selfish request, he would 
surely listen to her. For example, if she requested the development 
of a village in the Fittoa Region for its people.”
Now I understood. If she became a powerful woman herself, 
then she’d be able to tap into his money and influence. Even so, I 
194    
didn’t like the idea of Eris being with that pervert. “What are our 
other options?”
“As for the other nobles… With Lord Sauros and Lord Philip 
gone, Lady Eris doesn’t have any value left as the daughter of a noble 
family.”
Value, hm? Maybe that was how they saw it. In my eyes, Eris 
already had plenty of value just on her own.
“Lord Rudeus, which do you think is the best route for us to 
take?” Alphonse asked.
“Before I state my opinion, can I ask what Ghislaine thinks?” I 
hadn’t gathered my thoughts yet.
“I think Lady Eris should stay with Rudeus.”
“With me?”
“You’re Paul’s son. Zenith was also from a powerful noble family 
in Millishion. With your lineage and background, you should be able 
to make a place for yourself among the Asuran nobility.”
I wasn’t so sure about that. I looked at Alphonse to gauge his 
reaction.
“It’s not out of the question. Lord Paul has accomplished much 
during this incident. If you use that to your advantage, you should be 
able to consolidate some power and influence. However, getting the 
Liege Lord to let you oversee the Fittoa Region would be far more 
difficult. I can’t imagine Pilemon would allow a son of Lord Paul to 
have any power. I also can’t imagine that Lord James and Lord Darius 
would look kindly upon Eris marrying into the family of another 
influential person.”
No, I didn’t think so. Still, I more or less understood what 
Alphonse was getting at. He was thinking about how to ultimately 
secure the revival of the region.
195    
“In that case, Rudeus should just take Lady Eris and run away,” 
Ghislaine said.
“And then what happens to the Fittoa Region?” Alphonse 
snapped.
“You deal with it.” Ghislaine retorted coldly. Perhaps she and 
Alphonse just fundamentally did not get along.
“Would it not be the realization of our dearest wish, if Lady Eris 
were to take control over the land that Lord Sauros so loved?”
“That’s your greatest wish. Don’t lump me in with you. I just 
want Lady Eris to be happy.”
“And you think she’ll be happy if she runs away with Lord 
Rudeus?”
“Happier than if she’s forced to marry Pilemon,” Ghislaine 
argued.
“And what about the people of the region?”
“I don’t care about them. Lady Eris was never expected to deal 
with those matters from the start.”
It seemed our group of vassals was divided. Alphonse wanted 
Eris to follow in Sauros and Phillip’s footsteps and take over 
management of the land. If that required her to endure living with a 
pervert, she just needed to suck it up. Ghislaine, on the other hand, 
just wanted Eris to be happy. As far as she was concerned, Eris 
should abandon her political power and family name to elope with
me.
Personally, I leaned toward Ghislaine’s way of thinking. It wasn’t 
logical; it was entirely emotional. But still, I didn’t want a girl I cared 
about to be taken by some pig. If those were our options, then we’d 
be better off eloping. I didn’t care about political power. 
I did understand what Alphonse was saying, and why he thought 
it was important. I just didn’t agree with him.
196    
“Looks like we’re at a standstill,” I mumbled. And when I did, the 
two who had previously been arguing looked my way.
“What do you mean?” Alphonse asked.
“Whatever it is, Eris is the one who gets to decide. There’s no 
point in us even discussing it. So, let’s try to find a more constructive 
topic of conversation. Is there anything else?”
Alphonse stared at me dumbfounded. Ghislaine also went quiet 
again.
“If not, then I’m going to rest.”
Just like that, the day’s meeting ended.
197    
By the time the meeting ended, the sun had already set. I 
returned to my room. It was furnished with only the barest of 
essentials, and my luggage was strewn across it. While I recognized 
the need to tidy up, I felt no motivation to do so. Instead, I sat on my 
bed. My body sank into the hard mattress. I seemed to be more 
exhausted than I thought I was.
“Phew…”
Not that I’d done anything particularly exhausting today. Still, 
the fatigue clung fast to my body. Perhaps this was what people 
called mental exhaustion? No, that wasn’t it. I’d just received a huge 
shock. 
Sauros, Phillip and Hilda—I’d never had a particularly intimate 
conversation with any of them. Still, when I closed my eyes, I 
remembered going out for a long ride with Sauros, inspecting the 
region’s crops while he asked about how Eris was doing. I 
remembered Philip with that awful smile on his face as he proposed 
we take over the Boreas household together. I remembered how 
Hilda begged me to marry her daughter and become a part of their 
family. 
They were all gone now. Not even their house remained. That 
vast manor, through which booming voices had echoed, was gone. 
The reception hall where Eris and I had danced, the tower where the 
old man had his trysts, the library piled with documentation relating 
to the region…it was all just gone.
It wasn’t just the manor, either. Buena Village was gone, too; 
not that I’d gone to see for myself. The tree in our garden that Zenith 
treasured so much, the ones that were charred by lightning when 
Roxy was teaching me Saint-tier water magic, and the large tree that 
Sylphie and I had played under…all of those were gone, too.
198    
Wait…why were trees the only thing that came to mind when I 
tried to remember Buena Village? Well, whatever. It was all gone. I’d 
understood that logically after Paul told me as much, but seeing it in 
person was a bigger shock than I thought it would be. 
“Phew…”
Just as I let out another sigh, a loud banging came upon my 
door.
“Come on in.” I bade them enter.
It was Eris. “Evening, Rudeus.”
“Eris, are you all right now?”
“I’m fine,” she said as she came to stand before me, taking up 
her usual pose. She didn’t look depressed at all. Impressive as ever. 
Her family had been completely wiped out and she was still far 
stronger than I was. Actually, she usually wouldn’t even knock, just 
bust the door open with her foot. Perhaps she was depressed. 
“Well, I figured this was how things would end up.”
“Oh really…?”
Eris spoke as if it didn’t bother her at all. Like she said before, it 
seemed she’d prepared herself for this. Specifically, for the 
possibility of her family being dead. I couldn’t bring myself to do the 
same. Even now, not knowing where Zenith was, I had to believe she 
was alive. It was much more likely that she was dead, and I 
understood that intellectually, but couldn’t bring myself accept it.
“Eris, what are you going to do after this?”
“What do you mean?”
“Um, you heard about things from Mister Alphonse, right?”
“I did. But who cares about all that?”
“‘Who cares’…?” I echoed back.
199    
Eris was looking straight at me. Suddenly I realized—albeit a 
little late—that her outfit was different. She was clad in the black 
one-piece that she hadn’t worn once since she bought it back in 
Millishion. It matched so well with her red hair that it looked almost 
like a dress. I could see her breasts pushing through the thin 
material.
Huh? She’s not wearing a bra, then? Upon closer inspection, I 
realized her hair was a bit damp. I could smell soap too, something I 
only ever noticed right after she bathed. And it wasn’t just that. 
Normally, Eris didn’t have a particular smell to her, but I was catching 
a faint, sweet fragrance now. Perfume?
“Rudeus, I’m alone now.”
Alone—that was true. She had no family. She had brothers 
related to her by blood, but they weren’t family.
“And besides that, I recently turned fifteen.”
The moment I heard her say fifteen, I panicked. When? When 
had her birthday passed? Mine was just a month or two away, which 
meant hers must have been about a month ago. I didn’t even realize.
“Um, sorry for not remembering.”
Which day had been her birthday? I couldn’t remember her 
even dropping a hint about it. I would’ve thought Eris would make a 
lot of fuss over turning fifteen. Had there really been nothing? No 
day when she’d said something to indicate that it was her birthday?
“You may not have realized it, but it was the day that Ruijerd 
told me I was an adult.”
“Ahh.” So that was it. It all made sense now.
This sucks. I seriously didn’t notice, I thought.
“Uhhh, should I get something for you? Is there anything you 
want?”
“Yes, there’s one thing I want,” she said.
200    
“What’s that?”
“A family.”
I was at a loss for words when she said that. That wasn’t 
something I could give her. I couldn’t bring people back to life.
“Rudeus, become my family.”
“Huh?” When I suddenly looked at her, I could tell that despite 
how dark the room had grown, her face was bright red. Was 
this…well, you know…a proposal? “You mean like brother and 
sister?”
“I don’t care what you want to call it.” She was red all the way 
up to her ears, but she still wouldn’t turn her gaze away. “S-so, 
basically, what I’m saying is, um…let’s sleep together.”
I had no idea what she was talking about, believe me!
Just calm down and let’s think about the meaning of her words, I 
told myself. I could surmise, based on her proposal that we should 
sleep together, that she was shocked by everything that had 
happened, too. She probably wanted to be with me to heal the 
wounds inflicted on her heart.
A family. Or in this case, a pretend family, I suppose?
But…
“I’m feeling kind of lonely today, so I might end up doing 
something perverted to you.” 
To be honest, I had no confidence in myself. I mean, I wasn’t 
confident that I could get into bed with her, feel the heat of her 
body, and still be able to hold myself back. Even Eris should’ve 
understood that much. And yet…
“Y-you can do it today.”
“I already told you before, it’s not going to be just ‘a little bit’ if I 
do it,” I warned.
201    
“I remember. And I’m saying that you can have your way with 
me.”
After hearing her reply, I stared fixedly at Eris’ face. What the 
heck are you saying? I found myself thinking. I mean, come on. After 
being told that, my little man was now having his own little standing 
ovation.
“Wh-why are you suddenly saying all of this?” I asked.
“I promised you we would when I turned fifteen, right?”
“That was when I turned fifteen, right?”
“I don’t mind either way,” she said.
“I do mind.”
This was weird. Something was weird. Come on, think, what was 
it that was weird? Oh, I got it! In other words, Eris was feeling 
desolate. So perhaps she was being self-destructive. I’d seen scenes 
like this numerous times in erotic games. People comforted each 
other to cope when they lost someone. And by comfort, I mean 
locked their bodies together physically. Okay, yep, I got it.
Still, what did that say about me if I put my hands on her in this 
kind of situation? It was almost like I was taking advantage of her 
when she was weak. Of course, I wanted to do it, okay? The worst 
part of me was rejoicing: let’s throw away our virginity!
But wasn’t that something I should do under more normal 
circumstances? We were both in pain, and if we let ourselves be 
caught up in the moment, we would regret it later, I was sure.
Ahh, but I might not get another chance with her giving me 
permission like this. If she suddenly decided to go off and be with 
Pilemon, our promise would go out the window. 
No, forget that. I really didn’t want Eris’ first time to be stolen by 
someone else. I wanted to do it. I did. But I had a feeling we 
shouldn’t. 
202    
I’d made fun of all the indecisive protagonists of harem stories 
before. I’d called them cowards who couldn’t pluck up the courage 
when it was necessary. And now that it was actually my turn to be in 
the same situation, I was the one hesitating. 
What was I supposed to do? Whatever I decided, I felt like I’d 
regret it later. I would only stop regretting it two years from now 
when, on my fifteenth birthday, Eris would present herself with a 
ribbon wrapped around her body. “Here’s your birthday present. 
Since I might accidentally punch you, I tied my hands up too. Feel 
free to do what you want to me,” she would say as she sat atop my 
bed.
Ahh, no. Wait. I’d almost died recently. In what I’d thought were 
my final moments of life, I’d been full of regret. There were still 
things I wanted to do, and no guarantee that something similar 
wouldn’t happen in the two years that remained before my fifteenth 
birthday. It wasn’t like I could narrowly escape death forever. Maybe 
I should get rid of my virginity right now, before any similar troubles 
arose in the future?
No, but, wait a sec…
“Jeez!” 
Eris must’ve been frustrated at my indecision. She cleared her 
throat and then softly sat herself upon my lap. She positioned herself 
sideways so she could wrap her arms around my neck, presenting me 
with the vista of her tanned breasts and beautiful face. She opened 
her mouth like she was going to speak, then suddenly realized 
something was pressing against her thigh. Her face went even 
redder. “What the heck is that…?”
“It’s because you’re so cute.”
Eris merely hummed in return, and ground her thighs against 
the head of my little man. It was a soft and pleasant sensation. My 
203    
little man was overjoyed, and his father (me) was growing short of 
breath.
“This means you’re turned on right now?” she asked.
“Yeah.”
“So you don’t dislike me, right?”
“Nope.”
“Are you worried about my father and grandfather?”
“Yeah.”
“Rudeus, you’ve been giving me a naughty look this entire 
time.”
“Yeah.”
“But you’re still going to refuse me?”
“…Yeah.” I nodded finally.
My gaze was pinned to the base of her neck, her chest. She had 
already conquered my body with her soft thighs, the feel of her chest 
pressed against me, and her scent, which filled my lungs as I inhaled. 
I was like a dog wagging its tail. But I summoned the last threads of 
reason that remained within me and said, “A promise is a promise, 
isn’t it? We said we’d wait until I turned fifteen.”
In the moment, speaking frankly, that promise meant squat to 
me. Even I wasn’t entirely sure why I was holding myself back.
In response to my words, Eris just huffed. Her breath caressed 
my cheek.
“Hey, Rudeus. My mother taught me this, but since it’s 
embarrassing and I’m forbidden from using it anymore, I’m only 
going to say it once,” she said, taking in a deep breath. She brought 
her face close to my ear. 
204    
Then came a few words, in a tone so soft and sweet, it was as if 
a forbidden seal had been undone. “Rudeus, I want to be your little 
kitty. Mew~”
Those words went straight though my ear and infiltrated my 
simpleton’s brain, snuffing out the last threads of reason that were 
keeping me from giving in. Eris was a dog. A wild dog, even though 
her last word was 'mew'. In response to those words, I became a 
beast, too. A creature of instinct, one that shoved Eris down onto the 
bed.
205    
206    
   
That night, Eris and I ascended the steps to adulthood together. 
During that time, I forgot all about the other complicated matters 
weighing on us. All I could think about was how I wanted to be with 
Eris. I didn’t say as much, but I think I loved her. I wanted to protect 
her forever. I didn’t care about the circumstances. 
Paul had said it himself, hadn’t he? Who cared about a noble’s 
duties? I didn’t need to think about stuff like that. I would do 
anything to help her. While we were at it, three children would be 
fine, but I was sure we’d make more than that.
I was elated. It never even crossed my mind to wonder what Eris 
might be thinking.
Eris
My name is Eris Boreas Greyrat. 
That day, I became an adult. Rudeus gave me the present I 
wanted for my fifteen birthday. It was a bit different than what we’d 
promised, but we tied ourselves together all the same.
I loved Rudeus. When was it that I first started to realize my 
feelings? That’s right—it was on his tenth birthday. I was sleeping 
when my mother suddenly shook me awake, dressed me in a bright 
red nightgown and, with a serious look on her face, told me, “Go to 
Rudeus’ bed and surrender your body to him.” 
I wasn’t against having sex, but I was confused. My mother and 
Edna had explained it to me and made sure I understood it would 
happen some day. Still, I wasn’t prepared for it then. I’d thought it 
would be further in the future.
207    
Regardless of whether Rudeus knew of my trepidation, he 
touched my body anyway. He and my father had stayed up late 
talking together, so perhaps he’d already been told about this. As I 
considered that, another thought popped into my head.
Maybe he doesn’t actually love me.
Perhaps he was only doing it because my father told him to. 
Even back then, Rudeus was an amazing person. He knew everything 
and he could do anything, but that didn’t hamper his desire to keep 
learning. He just kept moving forward.
I was sure he suited me well. Yet, as his breathing grew ragged, I 
didn't get the sense he cared about my feelings. I was just a reward 
given to him by my father. When I realized that I wasn’t okay with it 
anymore, I shoved him away and made a dash for it. I started back 
toward my room, but then I got scared. Maybe I’d just done 
something that I could never take back. Maybe I’d just wasted my 
last chance. My mother told me that no one but Rudeus would have 
me, and I was sure she was right. I’d met with the other children of 
noble families numerous times, but none of them had as much grit as 
Rudeus.
Rudeus had been interested in my body ever since we first met. 
He’d tried to flip my skirt, pull down my panties, feel up my breasts. 
Each time, I’d punch him to drive him away. Back when I still 
attended school, I would punch boys who made fun of me, and they 
would never utter anything cocky to me again. That didn’t work with 
Rudeus. I honestly felt, with every fiber of my being, that when my 
mom said Rudeus was the only one, she was right. If he hated me, I 
thought I’d spend my entire life alone. 
Who cares if I’m just a reward? I thought. At least we can be 
together. So, I returned to his room. 
But when Rudeus saw me, he knelt to the ground and sprawled 
out like a frog. He apologized, saying he was the one in the wrong. In 
208    
response, I just looked down at him and told him to wait five more 
years. At the time, I thought that would be enough. Rudeus was 
enough of an adult to wait for me. 
That was when I started to fall in love with him.
However, things soon changed. We were transported off to godknows-where, and, when we awoke, there was a Superd standing 
before us. I thought I was being punished. Punished for only doing as 
I pleased. Whenever I was being really selfish, my mother would 
warn me that the Superd would come and eat me. I thought I would 
be eaten by the demon that had appeared before us. I should’ve let 
Rudeus do what he wanted to me that night, I thought. We could 
save serious sex for when we turned fifteen. I should’ve just endured 
it and let him have his way that night, until he was satisfied.
I cried out and cowered on the ground. And the person who 
came to my rescue was neither my grandfather nor Ghislaine—it was 
Rudeus. Rudeus worked things out with the Superd. Even though he 
must’ve been overwhelmed with anxiety himself, even though I was 
older than him, he calmed and soothed me. It must’ve taken a lot of 
courage for him to do that. I fell in love all over again.
After that, even as his face went pale, he dealt with the demon 
folk. He didn’t eat very much. He hid the fact that he wasn’t feeling 
well, physically. I was sure he was keeping his suffering to himself 
because he didn’t want to worry me, so I decided to restrain myself, 
too. I bit back the urge to yell and punch people, and let Rudeus 
handle things instead. I tried to act the same as I always did, but 
there were times where I just couldn’t hold it in—when the anxiety 
came boiling up from deep within me and wouldn’t stop. 
But Rudeus didn’t get angry. He just stayed beside me. There 
were no cutting remarks—he just stroked my head, wrapped his 
arms around my shoulders, and comforted me. During those times, 
he never once crossed boundaries. He was normally so playfully 
209    
obvious about being turned on by me, but during those times, he 
never touched me more than was necessary. Maybe he was trying to 
assuage my anxiety. He was thinking about me, not just himself. 
I wanted to become stronger. At least strong enough to not be a 
burden on him. The only thing I could do better than Rudeus was 
wield my sword, and even in that regard, I couldn’t compare to our 
companion, Ruijerd. And while I might have stood a chance in a 
swordfight, I couldn’t beat Rudeus when he used magic. 
Despite all that, Rudeus let me gain experience by fighting with 
them. I was sure the party would have had an easier time killing 
monsters and traveling overland if it had been just the two of them. 
The thought made me want to cry. I worried that Rudeus might 
realize I was holding them back, and come to hate me. I worried that 
he would leave me behind, so I worked desperately to get stronger.
I requested that Ruijerd train me. He knocked me down 
numerous times. Each time Ruijerd would ask me, “Do you 
understand?” Each time I would remember Ghislaine’s words and 
nod. Rationality—that’s right, rationality. There was a rationality to 
the way an expert moved. When training with someone stronger 
than me, the first thing to do was to observe them. 
Ruijerd was strong. Stronger than Ghislaine, most likely. And so, 
I watched. I watched his movements intently and mimicked them 
where I was able. Ruijerd helped me in my quest to get stronger. In 
the middle of the night, after Rudeus finally fell asleep, exhausted, 
Ruijerd would join me for training without once making a fuss about 
it. Of course, he still knocked me flat in every bout. Perhaps it was 
difficult for him to strike me down as he did, given how much he 
loved children, but I felt confident in calling him “Master.”
A year passed since we started our journey. I thought I’d 
become stronger. It was different from the understanding I thought 
I’d come to before, when I’d been told “Rationality, rationality!” 
210    
repeatedly by Ghislaine. Through my training with Ruijerd, I finally 
understood the true meaning of the word. Previously, I hadn’t seen a 
problem with sloppy movements in battle, but I now understood 
that each and every movement had meaning to it.
Then one day, I managed to defeat Ruijerd. In retrospect, it 
seemed like he had his attention drawn toward something else. Still, 
I didn’t care that it was a distraction which created the opening. I’d 
finally landed one on him. Now I wouldn’t be a hindrance anymore. I 
could walk beside Rudeus. 
Yeah, I sure let myself get carried away.
Rudeus easily deflated my swollen head. He’d suddenly acquired 
a demon eye and had no trouble using it to hold me down. I lost to 
him in a straight-up physical sparring match with no magic. It was a 
shock. It was cheating, I thought—foul play. In a single leap, he’d 
overtaken me on a road I’d walked for years.
I was just as much of a hindrance as ever. 
I cried in secret. Early the next morning I went to the beach and 
sobbed as I swung my sword. Ruijerd told me not to worry about it. 
Rudeus was just very compatible with the demon eye he’d received. 
He told me if I trained, I’d get stronger. That I had talent, and 
shouldn’t give up.
What talent? All Ghislaine and Ruijerd did was lie to me. At the 
time, Rudeus looked so grand to me. He shone so large and so bright 
that I couldn’t even look at him directly. I’d put him on a pedestal. I 
wanted to catch up to him, but I’d given up at some point, thinking it 
fruitless.
That changed after we crossed the Millis Continent. That was 
when we met Gyes and I learned there were combat techniques out 
there besides swordfighting and magic. I wanted to try to learn, but 
he refused me. At the time, I wondered why. I couldn’t accept it.
211    
Then there were the events in Millishion. I wanted to prove I 
could do things by myself, so I went to slay the simplest of 
creatures—goblins. That was when I caught the first glimpse of my 
own talent. I fought those strange assassins, and I overwhelmed 
them. At some point, I’d started to grow.
But when I went back to the inn, Rudeus was down in the 
dumps. When I pressed him for details, I found out that Paul was in 
the city, and that he and Rudeus had clashed. Even though Rudeus 
wasn’t crying, when I saw the extent of his depression, I finally 
remembered he was two years younger than I was. Yet despite his 
age, he’d become the home tutor for someone as selfish as I. He’d 
had to celebrate his tenth birthday away from family, and was forced 
to travel the Demon Continent while shouldering a burden like me. 
Then his father pushed him away.
I absolutely could not forgive that. As someone whose name 
was listed amongst the nobility of Asura, I promised myself that I was 
going to cut down Paul Greyrat. I’d heard of Paul’s strength from my 
own father. He was a genius swordsman who’d reached Advancedtier in Sword God Style, Water God Style and North God Style. He 
was also Rudeus’ father. Still, I didn’t doubt that I could win. 
Ghislaine had taught me swordplay, but Ruijerd taught me combat. If 
I combined the two, there was no way I would lose to that brute.
However, Ruijerd stopped me. When I asked why, he told me 
this was a fight between father and son. I knew Ruijerd regretted 
what happened with his own son, so I decided to listen. 
Ultimately Rudeus and Paul made up. It was just as Ruijerd had 
said. But I’ll say it again: I couldn’t accept it. I couldn’t understand 
why Rudeus forgave his father. I could never have forgiven someone 
like that. Rudeus didn’t talk much about it, and Ruijerd wouldn’t tell 
me anything, either. They were both adults.
212    
From there, we crossed over to the Central Continent. That’s 
when Rudeus started eating a bunch more, perhaps because he’d 
regained his spirit. As usual, he was incredible. In a single day, he 
managed to befriend the Third Prince and save his family.
As for me, the only thing I could do was go on a rampage with 
Ruijerd. We did help save Rudeus as a result, but we did it without 
any forethought. Afterward, Rudeus said things like, “I didn’t do 
anything,” and, “You guys really helped me out,” but judging by what 
happened, he could have dealt with it all on his own.
Rudeus was so great. Too great. And he only got even greater on 
that day when we encountered the Dragon God. During the 
confrontation with Orsted, Ruijerd and I were terrified by what we 
saw as the embodiment of fear before us. Only Rudeus was 
completely unaffected. 
He even managed to land an attack on Orsted—an opponent 
Ruijerd had been helpless against. My eyes couldn’t follow the magic 
he unleashed back then. When Rudeus actually got serious in battle, 
he was amazing. He actually managed to fight back against the man 
regarded as the strongest in the world, the Dragon God.
But just as soon as I thought that, Rudeus was fatally injured and 
dying. Until then, I’d thought death was something irrelevant to us. 
Rudeus was strong. There was no way he would die, and as long as I 
had him protecting me, I wouldn’t die, either. We also had Ruijerd 
with us, so we were safe. That’s what I’d thought. 
I was mistaken.
If that girl accompanying the Dragon God hadn’t spoken up on a 
whim, or if the Dragon God hadn’t been able to use healing magic, 
Rudeus would have been gone right there. I was so scared. That 
incident renewed my fears of being a burden.
Now, Rudeus was becoming godlike. Even though he’d almost 
been killed, he was completely nonchalant about it. Just three days 
213    
after he’d almost died, he was anticipating a future encounter with 
the Dragon God and practicing new magic to prepare for it. I couldn’t 
comprehend that. I couldn’t, and I was scared, so I just stayed beside 
him. I felt like if I didn’t stay with him, he’d disappear and leave me 
behind.
Then we parted ways with Ruijerd. Ruijerd said that beating the 
Dragon God was impossible, but right there at the end, he taught me 
something. He reminded me of the technique the Dragon God had 
used. It was burned into my mind, the way he’d deflected my attack. 
There was a method behind it. The Dragon God wasn’t an
unknown monster. He was a master, but he was using techniques 
known to man.
Finally, we made it home and I discovered nothing was left. My 
father, my grandfather, and my mother were dead. I was 
heartbroken. After everything I’d suffered to make it back here, my 
house and my family were gone. Ghislaine and Alphonse were there, 
but they felt distant and formal, like they were different people.
All I had left was Rudeus, and I wanted us to become a family. I 
was impatient. His contract to tutor me had been five years long, and 
we’d already passed that point long ago. He’d finished his duty by 
escorting me home. Not everyone in his family had been found yet. I 
was sure he’d immediately be off again, and he would leave me 
behind. I just knew it.
I used my body in order to keep him here. He hesitated at first, 
and I worried he wouldn’t accept me. Rudeus had always been 
interested in my underwear, but he never peeked in on me while I 
was bathing. Even on the ship traveling to the Millis Continent, when 
he could have touched me, stripped me, he didn’t. Maybe he wasn’t 
interested in my body. I spent all my time practicing the sword, and 
lacked the femininity that other girls had. I wondered if maybe, 
214    
despite how perverted he was, he didn’t actually want to have sex 
with someone like me. 
That wasn’t the case, though. Rudeus was turned on by me, and 
seeing him like that turned me on, too.
So, we connected our bodies. I’d never done it before, so it 
was painful at first, but gradually began to feel good. In comparison,
Rudeus seemed to be enjoying it from the very beginning. And yet, 
partway through he grew weak and feeble, as if he might break. That 
was when I realized, once again, that Rudeus was smaller than I was. 
He was quite robust down there, but he was shorter than me and 
more slightly built. 
He was so young, and yet he had always protected me. He spent 
the entire voyage healing my seasickness when we were on the ship, 
and was incredibly exhausted when we disembarked. How could he 
be fine after riding something that atrocious? There was no way. 
That’s right—if Rudeus hadn’t spent so much energy on healing me, 
then maybe he wouldn’t have been bested later that night by Gyes. 
Compared to that, what was I? I’d gotten more powerful. I’d gotten 
fairly decent at swordplay. But I got so caught up in my image of 
Rudeus’ magnificence that ignored how little he really was. In the 
end, I used my anxiety about losing my family as an excuse to force 
myself on him, and treated him poorly in the pursuit of my own 
desire.
I’ll say it again. I loved Rudeus. But I was not fit to be with him. I 
would only be a burden to him. We had become family, but we 
couldn’t become more than that. We couldn’t be husband and wife. 
It was as he'd said: we were better as brother and sister. We weren't 
well balanced. Even if we were together, I’d just keep holding him 
back.
For now, it would be better if we spent some time apart. This 
thought occurred to me naturally. As long as I was with him, I would 
215    
take advantage of his kindness. The sweet sensations of the night 
we’d spent together still lingered in my body, so much so that I 
ached for it. This was characteristic of the Greyrat family, though 
unexpectedly, Rudeus might not share those proclivities as strongly. 
He was trying his best to keep up with me, but at this rate, the 
fierceness of my desire might confuse him. I couldn’t do that to him.
I had no intentions of doing what Alphonse said, and marrying 
another man. It was too late for him to tell me to live like the 
daughter of a noble family. Being told to make sacrifices for the 
region’s citizens when I didn’t even really know those citizens had no 
appeal to me. My grandfather, my father, and my mother were all 
gone. The Fittoa Region was gone. What was the point?
I would discard the Boreas name. But I was still the 
granddaughter of Sauros, and the daughter of my parents, and so I 
would live on with an iron will. 
I’m going to get stronger, I resolved.
I would part with Rudeus and keep training. I wouldn’t stop until 
I could stand side-by-side with him. I didn’t have to be able to defeat 
him. But at the very least, I wanted to become a woman who was 
befitting of his stature. One who wouldn’t have people whispering 
behind her back if she got close to him. 
I didn’t have Rudeus’ shrewdness, so instead, I would seek 
power. Ghislaine, Ruijerd, and Gyes had said I had talent with the 
sword, and I would trust their words. I would follow Ghislaine’s 
recommendation and head to the Sword Sanctum. There, I would 
become a powerful, precise swordswoman.
A swordswoman (me) and a magician (Rudeus). The traditional 
pairing was the other way around, but both of us were fine with that. 
We would grow, get stronger, and meet each other again. Then we 
would take the next step in our family and become husband and 
wife. I would have his kids and we would live happily ever after,
216    
Now then, how should I go about telling him goodbye? Rudeus 
was an excellent speaker. No matter what I tried to say, he might 
stop me. He might try to come with me because he was worried 
about me being alone. 
Perhaps I should leave a note…? But knowing me, I’d probably 
leave some kind of trace behind when I did so. He could use that to 
track me down, and it would be a mess. He needed to move forward. 
I didn’t want to hold him back.
At times like these, it was best to act like the swordsmen in all of 
the stories and quietly leave. But Rudeus was always going on 
endlessly about reports, communication, and discussion. I didn’t 
want him to hate me.
All right. I would leave something short. Then, surely, Rudeus 
would understand.
Rudeus
Good morning, everyone! Yes, good morning to all you 
virgins out there, it’s a great morning! They say it’s only permissible 
to still be a virgin while you’re in grade school, so how about you 
guys? Ohh, me? I’m not so great. Ha ha, I’ll soon be thirteen. If we 
convert that to school years, that means I’m already in middle 
school. Ha ha!
Also, hello there to all you non-virgins! From today on, I’m one 
of you guys! In other words, I’m a “normie” now! I never thought I’d 
be joining you, but I hope you’ll give me a warm welcome, since I’m 
just a beginner. Like they say, rich people care about profit and 
fighting only brings losses, so let’s be friends! 
217    
I’d heard rumors that fleshlights felt even better than a real 
woman’s body, but they were all lies. Besides, fleshlights were 
missing various things, like real lips and a tongue. Sight, hearing, 
touch, taste, smell—there was something about sex that satisfied all 
five senses.
There was a saying back in my old world: “Don’t act like you’re 
her boyfriend just because you’ve had sex one time.” I understood 
what people meant by that, but—and I’m not really sure how to say 
this—but when I wrapped my arms around her waist and pulled her 
close, she slipped hers around my back and returned the embrace. I 
could hear her ragged breathing in my ear, and when I looked at her 
face, our eyes locked. If I kissed around her mouth, she’d stick out 
her tongue, and it was a flood upstairs and downstairs.
You just really feel like you belong to each other in that 
moment. It’s not just physically but mentally fulfilling, I guess? 
Wanting each other and giving yourself to each other? Those of you 
with tons more experience are probably thinking, “Don’t get carried 
away just because you did it once.” But I couldn’t help it. I wanted to 
act like I was her boyfriend. Eris probably wanted to act like she was 
my girlfriend, too.
Whoops, sorry about that. That was probably a bit too 
stimulating for you virgins out there. How rude of me. Based on my 
own internal sense of time, I’d been thirsting for forty-seven years, 
so I was a little excited now that I’d finally gotten what I wanted. Or 
maybe it was more accurate to say I’d lost what I wanted?
Long ago, I thought I’d try to keep it cool even if I managed to 
lose my virginity. Oops! Guess I was wrong. Oh my, it’s already this 
late? Sorry, I’ve got a date with my girlfriend to have some pillow talk 
this morning. I’m sure we’ll be getting it on hot and heavy tonight. 
Maybe we’ll get some afternoon delight, too!
Come on, Eris, it’s morning! Wake up. If you don’t wake up, I’m 
going to prank you, I thought playfully.
218    
Except she wasn’t there. The space in the bed next to me was 
empty. Well, she did tend to be an early riser, after all. What a 
shame. So much for the traditional morning pillow talk and 
subsequent coffee break.
“Oof!”
I lifted myself up. There was a pleasant exhaustion in the area 
around my hips. It was reassurance that what happened last night 
wasn’t just a dream. A truly delightful sensation.
I found my pants, but my underwear was missing. Oh well. I just 
put on my pants without them, and since Eris’ panties were at the 
side of the bed, I pocketed them. Then I slipped on a jacket and let 
out a big yawn.
“Hmm, this is good.” I’d never had a morning this refreshing 
before.
Just then, I realized something was strewn about the floor. 
There was something red scattered everywhere.
“Huh…?”
It was hair. Crimson hair that had fallen all over the floor.
“What the…heck is this…?” I grabbed a strand of hair and tried 
sniffing it. It was the same scent I’d caught a lot of last night—Eris’ 
scent.
“Wha…?” Confused, I looked in front of me and saw a single 
piece of paper. I grabbed it and read the words scrawled on it.
The two of us aren’t well-balanced right now. I’m setting off.
I digested those words carefully.
One second. Two. Three.
I flew out the door.
219    
I looked in Eris’ room. There was no luggage there. I went 
outside and entered the headquarters, where I found Alphonse.
“Hey, Mister Alphonse, where’s Eris?!”
“She set off on a trip with Ghislaine.”
“Wh-where?!”
Alphonse regarded me with cold indifference in his eyes. Then, 
he slowly said, “I was told to keep that a secret from you.”
“Oh… is that so…?”
Huh?
Why?
I didn’t get it.
Huh??
Why did she break up with me?
No, she abandoned me?
She left me behind?
Huh?
Family…?
What??
   
I spent a whole week sitting around unable to do anything, 
entirely dumbfounded. Occasionally, Alphonse would come by and 
nag me about getting a job or something. I didn’t think there was 
anything left in the Fittoa Region, but small, developing villages were 
gradually being built just a short distance from the refugee camp. 
People were even beginning to cultivate wheat.
220    
Per Alphonse’s instruction, I used earth magic to construct a 
defensive wall around the camp. The river threatened to flood with 
its embankment eroded, so I created a levee. Progress was gradual, 
but the restoration was proceeding. Apparently, earnest efforts at 
rebuilding would commence after the vast number of people from 
Millishion finished migrating here.
Eris chose death for herself.
The person known as Eris Boreas Greyrat was no more. In her 
place, there was now simply Eris. Alphonse said her decision was 
going to cause several complications, so any official announcement 
of her fate would be postponed a few years. He was probably acting 
on orders from Darius. Not that I cared.
Even though Eris was suddenly gone, Alphonse’s facial 
expression gave no indication it bothered him at all. Half-jokingly, I 
told him, “It’s a shame Eris got away,” but he just nonchalantly 
deflected it by saying, “Regardless, I have to work toward the Fittoa 
Region’s recovery.”
I needed to ask more questions to get a better handle on the 
situation. However, with Eris gone, I felt more or less apathetic about 
things. If the nobles wanted to fight over authority or whatever, they 
were welcome to do so.
I thought deeply about why Eris left. I reflected on my words 
and actions that night. However, no matter how I tried to backtrack, 
the only thing that stayed in my mind was our lovemaking. It was as 
if that moment drowned out all other details of that night. 
Maybe I was actually bad at it? I just followed my desires when I 
took the lead, so maybe she felt disillusioned by how things played 
221    
out? No, that would be odd. I was the one who went for it, but she 
was the one who invited me. 
No, that wasn’t it. Her fondness for me had just run out. As I 
recalled the past three years, I realized our trip was riddled with 
failures. We got here in the end, but that was largely thanks to 
Ruijerd. Eris must’ve hated the idea of being followed around by the 
cause of all those failures for another two years. That was why she’d 
fulfilled her promise early and said goodbye.
I had no idea why she acted as if there were a deeper meaning 
behind her actions, but for the moment, that was the conclusion I 
came to. In the end, I hadn’t really grown at all. It was no wonder her 
feelings for me had faded.
It was then that I suddenly remembered I had another mission 
of my own. “Ah, that’s right. I need to search for Zenith…”
And that was how I set out for the northern part of the Central 
Continent.
222    
Roxy Migurdia arrived in the town of Krasma, located at 
the tip of the northwestern part of the Demon Continent. It was a 
thriving town, albeit not as robust as Rikarisu. Though it looked 
unremarkable at first glance, this entire area was ruled by a Demon 
King. One with intimate ties to the seafolk, allowing the town to 
trade with them. With the seafolk came seafood, and with the 
demons came strong, fragrant spices unique to the Demon 
Continent, and it was in the town of Krasma that you could taste the 
delicious food that resulted from the combination. The town boasted 
such flavorful cuisine that it regularly tied with Wind Port for the title 
of the place on the Demon Continent with the most delicious food. 
“This food really goes great with some alcohol!”
Ever since they arrived in this town, Talhand had been in good 
spirits. Krasma didn’t just have the bitter alcohol of the Demon 
Continent, but the sweet alcohol of the seafolk as well. Talhand, 
being a dwarf, loved alcohol, and as long as the drinking was fun, he 
didn’t seem to mind how bad it tasted. When he went to the pub, he 
invariably hit it off with the ruffians there and drank enough alcohol 
to fill an entire bathtub. Pubs were everywhere in Krasma, so 
between that and the good food, Talhand was in paradise.
As for Roxy, she still had the tastes of a child despite her age, so 
the cuisine of this town didn’t agree with her. The food and 
seasonings of the Demon Continent weren’t her thing, on the whole. 
She liked sweet things.
The saving grace was the seafolk’s specialty, which was sweet 
alcohol. It came as quite a shock to Roxy, who’d only ever associated 
alcohol with bitterness. The liquor had an airy, seashore-like 
fragrance to it, and if you took a drink, an indescribably sweet flavor 
223    
would spread in your mouth. The aftertaste left a bit of saltiness, 
which only made you want to snack as you drank.
“Now that’s a rare sight! So you’re drinkin’ too, eh, Roxy?!”
“Yes, I am.”
“Yer in a good mood today, eh?” Talhand watched as Roxy drank 
and cheerfully put in his next order. “Barkeep, bring us a cask! I’ll 
teach ya how to drink like a dwarf!” 
In times like these, Roxy thought they were sure fortunate that 
things were so cheap on the Demon Continent. You could drink and 
eat as much as you wanted and still cover the cost with one Asura 
copper coin.
“Old man, you’re really chugging that down good!”
“Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!”
“Just what you’d expect from a dwarf!”
“Mmkay, let’s have a competition! Barkeep, bring me a cask, 
too!”
Incidentally, Elinalise had already disappeared into the night 
with some man she’d hit it off with. This was normally the point 
where Roxy would start to feel a bit alienated, but before she 
realized it, she and the girl sitting next to her were both hooting at 
the boisterous Talhand.
“Bwahaha! What a fine dwarf you are! No matter how the times 
may change, the dwarves remain the same! You agree with me, 
don’t ya?” the girl asked.
“Yes, certainly,” Roxy answered.
“Oh, here we go! Go on, chug! Chug! Chug!”
“Chug, chug!”
Talhand brazenly faced his drinking partner—a gigantic 
demon—with his arms wrapped around his cask, quaffing away. His 
224    
body was certainly broad, but you still couldn’t help but wonder 
where all that liquor was going. Once he emptied his enormous cask, 
he let out a guttural sigh. Just as quickly, the next drink was brought 
forth.
“Yer late with that alcohol!”
“Oh shut it! I’m out of stock!”
“In that case, go buy out the pub next door!”
“Ooh, there’s an idea! Okay then, you go buy it for us!”
“Just leave it to me! Put in yer coins, boys, put ’em in! We’re 
gonna drink it up tonight!”
“Yeaaaaah!”
They passed around a bag for donations.
“Haha! Miss, you’re being awfully generous to pitiful drunkards 
like us!”
“Yes, it’s my treat today!” Roxy dropped a green ore coin into 
the bag as it made its rounds.
Seeing that, the man holding it grinned hugely and chuckled as 
he bowed his head to her. “Impressive, miss! You must be rich!”
“Of course I am!” Roxy was in a pleasant mood, feeling light and 
airy as she nodded at him in an exaggerated way. She was, in fact, 
already drunk.
“Hahaha! I’m rich today too, so here you are, take it! And let’s 
make some more noise! We’re all friends here today!” The girl sitting 
beside her took a crude iron coin from her pocket and tossed it in the 
bag as well. 
The man holding the bag might have barked at her for only 
donating such a pittance, but he was drunk himself. “Heh heh! Thank 
ya kindly, princess! I’ll be usin’ this to make sure you guys drink until 
you’re pukin’!”
225    
“Yeah, let’s barf it all up!” The little girl gave a self-important 
nod as the man kept doing on his rounds, gathering up people’s 
money.
“Yeah, this is it, this is great! Makes me remember the old 
days!”
Roxy had no idea when the young girl had taken up the seat 
beside her. By the time she’d noticed, the girl was already there, 
munching on the food that Elinalise had left behind. Roxy didn’t 
mind. She was drunk.
“Well, here, have another.”
“Aah, thank you. Glad to see this is such a joyous atmosphere, 
makes me glad I came. Here, you drink some too!” the girl said.
“I am drinking,” Roxy replied.
“Drink some more!”
“More? I suppose I have no choice.” Roxy did as she was told, 
and gulped down the contents of the glass. “Pwah!”
“All right, one more for the young miss here!”
“Oh, thank you.”
She slammed her glass onto the table and some jovial 
gentleman came along and filled it for her. She really could drink this 
sweet liquor forever.
“You’re quite something, a real drinker! Quite amazing for 
someone so young!”
“I don’t want to hear that from you,” Roxy quipped, scrutinizing 
the girl. She wore boots that came up to her knees, leather hot 
pants, and a leather tube top. The pale skin of her clavicle, waist, 
belly button, and thighs were all in full view. She had voluminous 
purple hair set in waves, and horns like a goat. It was obvious, no 
matter how you looked at her, that she was younger than Roxy.
“Heh heh, no need for flattery. I know how old I am!”
226    
Roxy should have suspected something was up by now, but she 
didn’t have the wherewithal at the moment. Because she was drunk.
“I know my age as well,” she said. “Well, drink up.”
“Ohh, thank you. The alcohol here sure has gotten tastier in the 
last few hundred years. In the old days, the Demon Content didn’t 
have sweet alcohol like this.”
“This is the seafolk’s alcohol,” Roxy told her. “The Demon King 
here struck a deal with them.”
“What’s that! Bagura Hagura, you bastard, you hid this from me! 
I won’t forgive you for it!”
“Let it go,” Roxy cooed, “we’re all here as equals today, right? 
Equals!”
“Ohh, that’s right, we’re all equals here!”
Demon King Bagura Hagura was the ruler of this region. He was 
a burly, pig-faced demon, said to be the most knowledgable entity 
on the Demon Continent when it came to food and alcohol. 
Politically, he was a moderate, but still participated on the front lines 
of Laplace’s War. When he was on human lands, he’d stolen food 
and liquor from house after house, earning the title of the Plundering 
King.
“Ooh, he’s out!”
“Gwaaahah, who’s up next? I’ll take on anyone! If ya want, I’ll 
take on two of ya at once!”
At some point Talhand had stripped the clothes from his chest 
and perched himself squarely atop a table. He had his elbow 
balanced on top of a cask and was giving off an air of superiority.
“Anybody? Anybody at all?!”
The girl beside Roxy spoke up. “All right, leave it to me!”
“Whassat, girl, ya think ya can win against me? Maybe ya should 
try again in another twenty years.”
227    
“Ha ha ha! Foolish dwarf! I’ve already lived three hundred years! 
A mere twenty would change nothing!”
“Ah, is that so? M’bad, then. Go ahead and come at me!”
“Ah, but…first, I would ask you to state your name! I will be sure 
to remember you for being foolish enough to challenge me!”
“Talhand of the Harsh, Large Mountain Summit!”
“All right then! The one to defeat you will be I, the Demon 
Emperor of Demon Eyes, Kishirika Kishirisu!”
And so, Kishirika and Talhand’s battle began. The additional 
alcohol they bought was soon gone and funds had to be solicited a 
second and then a third time. Roxy took it upon herself to donate 
five whole green ore coins, sending the pub’s errand boy running to 
get more. Brawny men came carrying in large amounts of liquor, 
which those in the pub shared amongst themselves as Talhand and 
Kishirika drank away. Roxy was to be the judge. She had no idea how 
or what she was supposed to judge, but she took up a seat between 
them and sipped away at her own drink as she accepted the role of 
counting theirs.
“That’s number forty,” she announced.
Leaving aside Talhand, whose drinking habits matched his 
dwarven heritage, just where was Kishirika, who looked like a little 
girl and proclaimed herself a Demon Emperor, putting all that 
alcohol? No one seemed to mind it because they were all drunk. And 
then the deciding moment came.
“Mrgh… blegh…” Just seconds after Talhand squeaked out those 
strange noises, alcohol came rocketing out of him like a water 
fountain. Then he collapsed, clutching his stomach, which now 
resembled the casks he’d been drinking from. He fell from the top of 
the table to the ground with a noisy thud, alcohol spilling from his 
mouth.
“I win!”
228    
“Whooooa! Amazin’! You beat a dwarf in a drinking match!”
“My name is Kishirika, after all. The Demon World’s Great 
Emperor Kishirika Kishirisu! Now, say my name!”
“Kishirika! Kishirika! Kishirika!”
“Who’s the greatest in the world?!”
“Kishirika! Kishirika! Kishirika!”
A chorus of chanting broke out when Kishirika was announced 
the victor, brightening her mood.
“Ahahahahaha! Hahahaha!”
“That’s it, that’s it!”
“Take it off! Take it off!”
Roxy didn’t remember much after that. She knew she needed to 
avenge her fallen comrade, but she was suddenly dizzy, and 
unconsciousness was creeping up on her. The last thing she saw was 
Kishirika climbing up on the counter and dancing around naked.
The next morning, Roxy opened her eyes.
“Urgh…”
Her head was pounding, and her face puckered when she 
smelled the stench of alcohol on her own breath. She immediately 
used a spell specifically tailored for hangovers to remove the toxins 
from her body, then used a healing spell on her head. When she 
looked around, she realized she was in a pub. It looked as if there 
had been a brawl; the table was broken, and empty casks and 
shattered bottles lay strewn about.
“Urgh, I really did drink too much.” Her memory was hazy, but 
she did remember drinking too much. 
She glanced to the side to see a half-naked Talhand lying there 
with only the whites of his eyes showing. For a moment, Roxy 
229    
thought he might be dead, but a dwarf could never drink himself to 
death. Besides, Talhand used to say that he’d once dreamed of 
drowning to death in alcohol, so even if he had, it would have been 
the death he’d aspired to.
Roxy cast her gaze about the room once again. There were 
heaps of bodies everywhere, all spread about and moaning. Among 
them was the man who’d solicited money for more drinks. Everyone 
here had clearly drunk themselves into oblivion and was now 
suffering in the throes of a hangover.
That’s what you get for drinking so much when you can’t even 
use healing magic, Roxy thought.
Among the sea of unconscious forms, only two people were 
standing—an angry barkeep and a disheartened Kishirika.
“Compensation, I’m asking for compensation. I can’t sell nothin’ 
with all the destruction you all caused.”
“Yeah, uh, but…”
“What, you can’t pay? Ain’t you the one who said you’d be 
treatin’ everyone?”
“I did say that, but I thought what I paid already would be 
enough…”
“So you don’t have any money, do ya?”
“No, uh, sorry, not a single crude iron.”
“Then I have no choice but to sell you in the slave market.”
“What? You would dare sell me…?! Wait, wait, I’ll contact 
Hagura, just hold on!”
“I’m not gonna hold. You’re just sayin’ that so you can run 
away.”
Roxy let out a sigh and dug into her pocket. She made a face 
when she produced her coin bag and saw the state of it. She’d 
donated a hefty portion of her funds when she was drunk last night.
230    
No, the one who actually drank all of that was Talhand, she 
thought. Roxy turned to the unconscious Talhand and swiped his 
coin purse. She peered inside, found a decent amount within, and 
took to her feet. There was a sour smell coming from her shoulder, 
which she scrunched her face at as she approached the barkeep. 
“Here’s your money.”
“Hm?”
Roxy took out six whole emerald ore coins and tucked them into 
the barkeep’s hand.
“That ain’t quite enough.”
“We bought up all your booze before we started sending out for 
more. You have the earnings from that, don’t you?”
“Ah…well, I guess,” he said as he turned on his heel and headed 
back into the kitchen area.
Roxy let out another sigh as she tossed the coin purse onto 
Talhand’s belly.
“Ooh…ooooh…I’m sorry, I’m so sorry!” Kishirika was trembling 
as she looked up at Roxy.
Roxy looked down at her, remembering what she’d heard from 
her old village chief about the Demon World’s Great Emperor. She 
was a bit different from what Roxy had pictured, but her peculiarities 
lined up. If she was from a demon tribe with a long lifespan, it made 
sense that her physical appearance didn’t match her age. She 
seemed to be on good terms with the Demon King of the area, too.
“Excuse me, just to confirm—I’m not mistaken in assuming that 
you are the Great Emperor of the Demon World, Kishirika Kishirisu 
herself, am I?”
“Hm? Oh, that’s right! No one seems to believe me lately, 
though! And your name is?”
231    
“Pardon the late introduction,” Roxy said. “I’m Roxy, of the 
Biegoya Region’s Migurd tribe.”
Kishirika gave an, “Oooh,” when she heard Roxy’s name. “Roxy? 
Ohh, I know you! You’re Rudeus’ master!”
“…You know Rudy?”
“I happened to run into him in Wind Port. That boy was quite 
entertaining!”
“Y-you don’t say…” Roxy wondered suspiciously just what it was 
that Rudeus had said about her, but she was too scared to ask. 
“Hm, Rudeus helped me in a pinch, and you’ve shown yourself 
to be a great teacher. You helped me as well, so let’s see…why don’t 
I give you a reward?”
Roxy’s heart leaped when she heard the word reward. The Great 
Emperor of the Demon World was famous for bestowing demon eyes 
on people. It was precisely because of that power that she was called 
Emperor rather than King, and it was that ability which had given her 
the military strength to launch the Great Human-Demon War. 
Which gave Roxy an idea. “Um, Your Greatness, are you able to 
look for missing people with your demon eyes?”
“Yes, I can. There’s not a person in this world I can’t find,” 
Kishirika boasted.
“All right…then I’d like you to look for Rudeus and his family. 
They’re currently missing,” Roxy said without hesitation. It was a 
shame to forego receiving a demon eye from Kishirika, but she’d 
heard Kishirika’s Eye of All-Seeing could find anything and anyone, 
anywhere in the world.
“Oho, how admirable of you, to use your one and only wish for 
the sake of another! Were the world such that I was in the position 
to do so, I’d bestow upon you the position of Demon King!”
“No, I don’t need that.”
232    
“Oh, I see, too humble for that. Well, then…” Kishirika’s eye 
rotated, changing color. She craned her neck this way and that, 
humming to herself as she nodded. “Rudeus is in the northern part 
of the Central Continent. He’s wearing light clothing and running. 
Training, perhaps.”
Roxy bobbed her head. It seemed that, just as the message left 
for him had requested, he was going to search the northern part of 
the Central Continent. He could’ve headed straight for Begaritt from 
Millishion, but he’d probably wanted to see the state of his home 
before he set off.
“His father is in Millishion, along with a maid. Hmm, the maid is 
apparently named Lilia…and they’re living in the same building, with 
their two daughters.”
“Oh,” Roxy let her breath out. She’d heard that Lilia and Aisha 
were still missing, but they’d apparently been found and were safe. 
Perhaps Rudeus had found them on the Demon Continent and 
escorted them home. 
“His mother is…hold on a moment.” Kishirika hummed and 
screwed up her face, squinting her eye. “She’s in Begaritt Continent, 
in the Maze City of Rapan…it seems.”
Roxy’s face lit up. It was far from here, but at least she’d 
confirmed that they were all alive. As you’d expect of the Greyrat 
family—their luck was strong.
“However…something is a bit odd.” Kishirika’s face scrunched 
and her eye slowly turned.
“Is there some kind of problem?”
“No…hmm, I can’t quite see.”
“You can’t see? Even with your eye, Your Greatness?”
“I’m not quite at my full strength yet,” Kishirika explained. 
“Well, you’ll understand if you see for yourself.”
233    
234    
“That’s troubling. If something’s wrong, I need to know the 
details.” Roxy pressed her for an explanation. In her ventures thus 
far, she’d seen the tragedies that befell the refugees. It was 
disconcerting that even the Great Emperor of the Demon World was 
having trouble zeroing in on Zenith with her demon eyes. 
“Well…complain if you like, but I can’t see what I can’t see. Ohh, 
that’s right. This may come as a surprise, but she may be in the 
middle of that labyrinth. It’s a labyrinth city, and I’ve never been 
there myself, so I can’t say for sure.”
“You can’t see inside the labyrinth?” Roxy asked.
“No. Begaritt’s labyrinth is overflowing with a high 
concentration of mana.”
Roxy fell into thought. Zenith had once gone dungeon delving 
with Paul, Elinalise and Talhand. She understood their strength well 
after journeying alongside them. However, why hadn’t she been in 
contact yet? Three years had passed since the Displacement 
Incident.
“At any rate, she is alive, yes?”
“Indeed, there’s no doubt about that,” Kishirika assured her.
Roxy decided to believe those words. Whatever the reason, they 
would have to delve into that labyrinth. 
She lowered her head. “I understand, then. Thank you.”
“Think nothing of it. It’s a show of gratitude for the help you 
provided.” Kishirika gave an exaggerated nod and, still a little 
unsteady on her feet, took her leave from the pub.
   
235    
That afternoon, Talhand awoke and resumed his drinking as if 
nothing had happened, and Elinalise returned with hickies peppered 
across her neck. Roxy gathered the two of them for a meeting.
“It was good fortune to run into the Great Emperor of the 
Demon World.” When she heard about Kishirika, Elinalise just 
laughed quietly. Roxy didn’t think it was that significant an event, 
perhaps because they’d met while they were drunk at a pub. Or 
perhaps it was Kishirika’s lack of dignity.
“Leavin’ that aside, that means our journey’s over, right?” 
Talhand responded, seeming a bit reluctant to see the end of their 
quest.
It would take them a year to reach the Millis Continent from 
here, but it was true that their objective had been fulfilled. They’d 
confirmed that all of Paul’s family were alive, and even knew where 
the last two were located. It was over.
“What are you going to do, Roxy?”
“I’m going to return to Millishion and talk to Paul about what I 
found,” she said.
“Then we’ll part ways with you somewhere before then,” 
Elinalise replied.
It seemed Elinalise and Talhand didn’t want to meet Paul. The 
reason was apparently the huge fight they’d had when he left, but 
they wouldn’t tell her exactly what had happened. Roxy wasn’t 
particularly interested, either, so she hadn’t been all that persistent 
in asking.
“Hmm, but Rudeus is pretty far off and all by himself,” Talhand 
blurted out, pressing his hand to his chin.
That brought Roxy to a sudden realization. She would head to 
Millishion from here, and then, most likely, travel alongside Paul to 
the Begaritt Continent. If she did that, then Rudeus would be left 
236    
alone, unaware of the circumstances, searching the northern part of 
the Central Continent by himself. 
“We need to find some way to let him know,” Elinalise said, 
concerned.
But how? The northern part of the Central Continent looked 
nearby on a map, but it was much further in reality. Roxy fell back 
into thought. Rudeus was exceptional, but he was still young. It was 
cruel to leave him to struggle in vain in such a vulnerable period of 
his life. Whether he reunited with his family or struck out on his own, 
she at least wanted to tell him that he didn’t need to search 
anymore.
“And that’s where I come in…du-du-du-dun!”
“And me! Dun-du-dun!”
Suddenly, two interlopers appeared out of nowhere.
“I listened in on your conversation!”
“By eavesdropping!”
The first to come bursting through the door was a well-built 
man. A single glance at him was enough to know he was a demon, 
for he had skin like obsidian and six arms. The ones on top were 
folded in over his chest, the ones in the middle were making finger 
guns at Roxy, and the bottom ones were resting on his waist. His 
hair, which flowed down to his waist, was purple. Perched on his 
shoulder, reclining at leisure, was the Demon World’s Great 
Emperor.
“Here we go! I’m Kishirika Kishirika! People call me… the Great! 
Emperor! Of! The! Demon! World!”
“And I’m her fiancé, the Demon King Badigadi!”
The other three stared, dumbfounded. The first to react was 
Elinalise. “Um, I think we last saw each other this morning, sir.”
237    
“Ahahaha, I had an amazing night with you, miss!” Badi 
clenched one fist and inserted his thumb between his index and 
middle finger as he responded.
Roxy felt a sudden cold sweat as she asked, “D-do you two know 
each other?”
“Um, basically, I guess we do…?”
Apparently, Elinalise had left the pub Roxy was in and gone with 
a man to a different one last night. There, the man had plied Elinalise 
with alcohol, and she had happily returned the favor. Next thing she 
knew, she was waking up in the pitch-black arms of the man before 
them. After which, the two of them went at it again all afternoon.
“Huh? But just now, you said fiancé…what? Ah, I suppose we 
should introduce ourselves first?” Flustered, Roxy’s eyes darted back 
and forth, but she finally settled on bowing her head.
“Hm, Roxy, raise your head. Since Badi is so popular, this is a 
near-daily occurrence.”
“Hm, more like it’s physically impossible for me to put it in 
Kishirika yet, so I have no other choice.”
The words were spoken in such a carefree manner that Roxy’s 
brain struggled to digest their meaning. Courtesy of Elinalise, she had 
gained a smattering of knowledge on such matters, but the 
adulterous relations between her companion and a man who called 
himself a Demon King and the fiancé of the Great Emperor of the 
Demon World went beyond her realm of understanding.
“However! Leaving all of that aside!”
“Indeed; it’s just a passing fling anyway!”
Roxy knew of the Demon King Badigadi, or the Immortal Demon 
King Badigadi, as he was known. He was the Demon King who ruled 
over the Biegoya Region, younger brother of the Immortal Demon 
King Atofe. Atofe was aligned with the moderates during the war and 
238    
fought against the Demon God Laplace at Kishirika’s Castle, where he 
was defeated. His current whereabouts were unknown, but he was a 
venerated figure.
“Roxy, I owe a debt to Rudeus. If he has lost his way, then I will 
lend him my strength!”
“Although she’ll be borrowing my strength to do it!”
Before Roxy, as confused as she was, could respond, Talhand 
recovered. He stroked his thick beard, directing a quizzical look 
toward Kishirika. “Yer sure about this?”
“Ooh, you’re the dwarf from yesterday! Yes, I’m sure, right, 
Badi?” Kishirika smacked him on the head and the Demon King 
nodded.
“Yeah, I’m curious about this brat named Rudeus whom 
Kishirika keeps praising every chance she gets! I want to see with my 
own eyes just how great he really is!”
“What’s this? Are you jealous, darling?” Kishirika cooed.
“Why of course I am, honey,” Badi replied in turn.
“Tsk, you’re still such a child. I love you and only you.”
“Heh, I’m not going to let that make me complacent. I’ll crush 
any rivals who appear.”
And you crushing Rudeus would be bad, Roxy thought to herself, 
but she had a feeling they wouldn’t listen to her.
“Heh heh heh.”
“Hahaha.”
“Ahahahaha! Hahahah! Haha-urk!”
“Hahahaha! Ahahaha! Ha… you okay?”
The conversation proceeded apace before Roxy could even 
begin to make sense of it.
239    
   
It was common knowledge in this world that the seas were ruled 
by the seafolk, who in turn controlled the ability of those living on 
land to cross them. This setup was a result of discord that broke out 
in the process of Laplace’s War coming to an end, but we’ll leave that 
aside for now.
The Demon King Bagura Hagura and the King of the Seafolk 
were close personal friends, and the King of the Seafolk allowed his 
friend passage in secret. Meanwhile, Demon King Badgadi and the 
Demon King Bagura Hagura were also old acquaintances. By making 
use of that connection, their group could bypass the route that 
would take them through the Divine Continent, and head straight for 
the Central Continent instead. 
However, if Roxy went with them, the report to Millishion would 
be delayed. Someone had to go to Millishion to update Paul, and 
Roxy couldn’t do it alone. The Demon Continent was too dangerous, 
even for an exceptional magician like her. Her judgment was sharp 
and her spell incantation quick, but she still had to sleep at night.
“I absolutely refuse. I don’t want to see Paul’s face,” said 
Elinalise.
“Yeah, me either,” Talhand chimed in.
“Very well, then. I will be the one to go.” Since the two of them 
were being selfish, Roxy would first head to Millishion. Personally, 
she would have preferred to see Rudeus, but she had no other 
choice. 
She just needed one more to go with her. The two exchanged 
glances, and soon enough, Talhand folded. “Guess it’ll be me. To tell 
the truth, not lookin’ forward to bein’ on one of those ships again.”
“My sympathies,” Elinalise said.
240    
Talhand’s shoulders drooped. Roxy didn’t see why the two of 
them couldn’t just head to Millishion and inform Paul via letter, but 
they apparently had their reasons, so she didn’t think too deeply 
about it. 
And so, Roxy’s party split into two. Roxy and Talhand would 
retrace their path back to Millishion. Elinalise would travel with the 
Great Emperor of the Demon World Kishirika Kishirisu and the 
Demon King Badigadi to the northern part of the Central Continent. 
There was quite a bit of time before the latter’s ship set off, so Roxy 
decided to depart ahead of them.
“Miss Elinalise, thank you for everything.”
“Same to you, Roxy.” The two exchanged a firm handshake. “If 
you find a good man, you better not let him go. You have to use your 
upper and lower lips to get a tight grip on him.”
“You’re bringing that up again?”
“None of that, just listen to me. If there’s someone you really 
like, go hard for them. Love is something that can grow afterward.”
Talhand breathed a sigh at Elinalise’s words. “You said the same 
thing to Zenith, didn’t ya?”
“I did. That’s how she got Paul. My teaching is flawless.”
So that’s it, Roxy thought as she listened in. Paul and Zenith 
seemed like the ideal husband and wife to her. If it was Elinalise’s 
advice that brought them together, then it was advice worth 
listening to.
“Very well, Miss Elinalise. If I find such a person, I will ‘go hard 
for them.’”
“Of course. I’ll be sure to tell Rudeus how miserable you were at 
night, rustling in your bedsheets as you went at it alone.”
“Wait—why do you know about that? And please don’t say that. 
I wasn’t thinking about Rudy when I did it.”
241    
“Of course, of course.”
Roxy had a realization just then. If Elinalise began her search 
now, she’d probably find Rudeus within about a year. Rudeus would 
be thirteen or fourteen by now. At that age, it wasn’t unusual to 
think Elinalise might be interested in him. That kind of bothered her.
“You went quiet all of a sudden. What’s wrong?”
“No, it’s just… If Rudy has become a fine man, will you go for 
him?” 
Roxy tried to sound as casual as she could when asking, and 
when she did, Elinalise breathed out a disgusted, “Ha! I don’t have 
the faintest desire to become Paul’s daughter-in-law.” She looked 
genuinely disgusted.
Feeling reassured, Roxy just said, “Oh, all right.” Then, “Well, 
we’d best be on our way.”
“Farewell, Roxy. Have a safe trip.”
“Yes, you too, Miss Elinalise.”
Elinalise took a glance at Talhand. She loomed over the short, 
stubby dwarf, glaring down at him as if he were some kind of insect. 
“Talhand, please go off and die in a ditch somewhere.”
Talhand looked equally displeased at seeing her and hocked 
some spit onto the ground. “I’m returnin’ those words right back to 
ya.”
Watching this, Roxy was reminded once again that the two of 
them were, somehow, close.
Later, Elinalise boarded her own ship. It was a seafolk vessel, 
back in ancient times. It was pulled along by sea creatures, making 
the human-made ships look shabby in comparison, but human ships 
were actually faster and safer.
242    
Elinalise walked up the ramp alongside Badigadi. From behind 
them came Kishirika’s echoing laughter.
“Hahahaha! Well then, let’s see each other again, Badi! When 
you want to see me again, return to the Demon Continent!”
“Indeed, and stay in good health as well, my betrothed! We’ll 
eventually meet again! Ahahaha!”
“Who knows how many years it will be until the next time, 
though! Bwaahaha!”
The Great Emperor of the Demon World, Kishirika Kishirisu, did 
not board the ship. When Elinalise saw that, she cocked her head. 
“Hm? She’s not going to come along with us?”
“Mm. Kishirika can’t leave the Demon Continent.”
“Oh, a curse?”
“Something like that.”
If that was how things were, Elinalise would have preferred 
Kishirika accompany Roxy and Talhand. Their safety would be 
assured with the Great Emperor of the Demon World around. Then 
again—she thought about what it would be like for Roxy to have 
someone like Kishirika following her around, and changed her mind.
Meanwhile, Roxy Migurdia’s journey continued.
243    
There were vast expanses of water-filled paddies in the 
Sanakia Kingdom. A carriage rolled slowly along a path separating 
said paddies, protected by a number of knights. The knights walked 
along with relaxed looks on their faces, and the carriage didn’t look 
expensive, so it was safe to assume no one important was riding 
inside. 
And, in fact, the only people in the carriage were three women. 
One was a knight of the Shirone Kingdom named Ginger York. She sat 
near the door, listening to the conversation of the other two.
“Big Brother Kennel Master really was dreamy.” The one 
speaking so enthusiastically was the young girl in baggy maid’s 
clothing, Aisha. “If I’m ever going to get married, it definitely has to 
be to someone like that. Right, Mother?”
“Y-yes, of course.” Sitting opposite was a woman identical to 
Aisha, but older and wearing glasses. Her name was Lilia. Anyone 
who looked past the frames would see the cool glint in her eyes, 
giving off a distant and frosty impression. And yet, her gaze was 
currently shifting around.
“He was totally amazing when he saved me, you know? He 
pointed his finger at the ground like this, and swished, then a hole 
opened up, and then after that we went whooshing through the air! I 
wonder if that was magic too? It’s amazing he can cast all that 
without chanting anything. Almost like the magic in fairytales.”
“Yes, indeed. It’s incredible…being able to cast like that without 
incantations.”
Aisha had been singing the praises of “Big Brother” Kennel 
Master for a while now. Lilia was a bit perplexed. She’d been sure at 
first that Aisha had realized the Kennel Master was actually her older 
244    
brother, Rudeus, but it was starting to look like she was just using 
“big brother” as a term of endearment for an older male figure.
“Besides, that was a first for me. I was so scared I wet myself, 
and yet, I wasn’t embarrassed because he was the one with me. I 
didn’t mind that he helped me get changed… Could this maybe…be 
love?” Aisha put her hands together as if in prayer, her eyes alight.
Seeing her daughter like that, Lilia hesitated. Should she tell her 
that the Kennel Master was actually Rudeus? Just the other day, 
Aisha had hated him. Granted, Lilia’s approach hadn’t been the best. 
She’d always gone on about how amazing and wonderful Rudeus 
was, wanting Aisha to serve him someday, but Aisha was 
exceptionally smart herself, and she’d seen right through her 
mother’s exaggerated claims that her brother was perfect beyond 
reproach. She’d sniffed out the flaws Lilia was covering up, and 
honed in on them.
People tended to assign great importance to the things they 
discovered for themselves, rather than what they heard from other 
people. A few years from now, Aisha would realize that what she’d 
been told was just as credible as the information she discovered for 
herself, but she was still too young for that. She thought that her 
mother was full of lies and that Rudeus was actually a good-fornothing human being.
Lilia acknowledged she was partly to blame for that. She could 
have found better ways to tell Aisha about Rudeus, ones that didn’t 
include going on and on about him as if he were an object of 
worship. But didn’t matter if she admitted her mistakes now; Aisha 
had made up her mind about Rudeus. At some point in their stay in 
the Shirone Kingdom, Lilia had given up on changing her daughter’s 
mind. However, by some twist of fate, Aisha was now lavishing praise 
on her brother the Kennel Master.
245    
Lilia paused to think. If she were to reveal that Aisha’s beloved 
Kennel Master was actually Rudeus, wouldn’t Aisha’s hatred of her 
brother disappear? Wouldn’t she be willing to serve him, just as Lilia 
wished? 
Then again, Aisha hated lies and deceit, and Rudeus had hidden 
his true identity from her the entire time. Lilia had no idea why he’d 
done it, but Aisha was a clever girl who saw right through adults’ 
attempts to gloss things over. Revealing that the Kennel Master was 
really Rudeus this late in the game might only make her hate him 
more. “See, he is underhanded!” she might say, or “I knew it, my 
brother is a pervert!” or “He wanted to wash my panties so bad that 
he lied to me!” Lilia would rather avoid that.
“Heey, Motherrrr. If my brother is actually dead, I’d like to serve 
the Kennel Master instead~”
“…”
Normally, at this point, Lilia would smack Aisha on the head and 
chide her not to say such ominous things. This time, she could do 
nothing but offer her a bitter smile as a cold sweat beaded on her 
face.
Should she tell Aisha that the Kennel Master was Rudeus or not? 
If she played her cards right, Aisha would come to love her brother. 
But if she failed, Aisha would hate him even more. The latter was 
unacceptable, but Lilia wasn’t confident she could persuade her fartoo-clever daughter. What should she do? 
Unable to come up with an answer, she was forced to listen to 
Aisha’s rambling.
“I’d do my best if I were to serve the Kennel Master. But then 
one day, when my guard’s down and I’m getting changed and all 
defenseless, he’ll come in and push me down, all hot and bothered, 
and make me his mistress. That will mark the beginning of a daily 
routine of obscene lovemaking. To me, it’ll just be a physical 
246    
relationship at first, but then one day he’ll propose to me, saying ‘I 
want your heart as well,’ and…hee hee!”
“…”
Unbeknownst to Lilia, who was agonizing over her decision, 
Aisha was laughing to herself. She’d already seen right through 
everything—she knew the Kennel Master was really her brother, and 
while he wasn’t perfect, he was as exceptional as her mother had 
said. She was just using this opportunity to torment Lilia.
In all honesty, Aisha didn’t have the best relationship with her 
mother. Lilia had always been overcontrolling, ordering her to do this 
or that ever since she was little, refusing to give her an explanation 
even if she asked for one. And, apparently, the strict training her 
mother put her through was all so that she could someday serve her 
older brother. It was no wonder Aisha had grown sick of it… until she 
saw her brother in person. She witnessed his ability to react 
intelligently to his environment by using voiceless magic to aid in 
their escape, as well as his courage in charging into the Shirone Royal 
Palace to rescue her mother, and his kindness after being peed on 
and helping her wash up and get changed with no sign of disgust. All 
of that was enough to make Aisha giddy, as she realized, “So this is 
what people mean when they say ‘dreamy’!”
Her brother was exceptional, and if she wanted to be keep up 
with him, she had to be exceptional, too. Once she understood that, 
she was actually grateful for everything her mother had made her 
do. Without all that training, she might balk at the idea of serving 
such an extraordinary older brother.
“Ah-ah, I wonder if my brother really is dead. Then I can go 
straight into the arms of the Kennel Master.”
“A-as long as Lord Rudeus hasn’t passed, you’re going to serve 
him, you understand?”
247    
“Of course, I know that.” This was the first time Aisha had ever 
seen her mother so flustered. “But just for a year, okay? After that I 
want to spend the rest of my time with the Kennel Master~”
“N-no, that’s unaccept—hmm…”
Aisha continued to enjoy teasing Lilia for a while after that.
   
The woman known as Lilia was born in a remote village in the 
Asura Kingdom. Later, she was the only girl in a Water God Style 
swordplay training hall in a mid-sized city in the Donati region. She 
had no surname. Commoners in the Asura Kingdom were not given 
surnames. Lilia was born as just Lilia, and as it was her father who 
owned the hall, she picked up a blade at a young age and learned 
rapidly.
Like her parents, Lilia was terrible with words. She conducted 
herself coolly and quietly, and didn’t have much charm to her. 
However, she was a hard worker, so those around her all loved her. 
Even though it was clear she had no talent for the sword, she was 
still endearing to the other students who saw how eagerly she 
practiced. The students doted on her as if she were their little sister, 
and she gained a bunch of older brothers in turn. Her life was the 
peaceful vista you’d expect from a small, rural sword training hall.
The students’ gazes began to change when Lilia was about 
thirteen. As her body welcomed the changes that accompanied 
puberty, the other students stopped showering with her and avoided 
speaking with her one-on-one. They didn’t specifically avoid her or 
try to exclude her, but Lilia could vaguely sense their hot gazes on 
her. 
248    
Lilia was a very realistic girl. She had no brothers, and her 
mother’s physical condition had worsened after her birth. With no 
son to be heir to the sword training hall, her mother was left feeling 
apologetic while her father wracked his brain over what to do. That 
was why Lilia assumed she’d eventually marry one of the students, 
who would then inherit the hall in her stead. The students were all 
like brothers to her, which was why none of them particularly stood 
out as candidates for marriage, but she could tell how they kept each 
other in check when she was around.
It became a hot topic of discussion in the hall as to who the 
master, her father, would select both as her partner in marriage and 
the next master of the hall. Behind the scenes, those interested in 
becoming the master or simply interested in marrying Lilia began to 
compete with one another. Time wore on without anything being 
decided, but Lilia was sure that the future she envisioned would 
eventually come to pass.
It was around then that Paul tumbled into their midst. Even 
though he had no money or a place to live, Lilia’s father readily 
welcomed him. With his bright and energetic personality, Paul 
became popular with everyone in a flash. He was also blessed with a 
talent for swordsmanship, and quickly absorbed their techniques, 
likely thanks in part to what he’d already learned with the Sword 
God Style. It had taken Lilia ten years to accomplish as much and 
he’d caught up to her, then surpassed her. In no time at all, he’d 
grown so skilled that even her father couldn’t compete with him.
Paul was talented with the sword and popular with the other 
students. Because of that, it was soon decided that he would be 
Lilia’s life partner. Although Lilia was bewildered by the suddenness, 
the speed at which things had proceeded set her heart aflutter. Paul 
was unlike all the other people she’d seen before. He was so freespirited; he possessed neither rigid thinking where swordsplay was 
249    
concerned, nor firm beliefs on lineage and inheritance. His carefree 
lifestyle seemed dazzling to Lilia.
But Paul was a bit too different from the other denizens of the 
training hall, and it wasn’t just his lax views on swordsplay, 
household duties, or lineage, but also his approach to women. 
Although the other students had readily welcomed Paul at first, 
discord began to develop between them. They didn’t look too kindly 
upon someone who’d appeared out of nowhere and stolen the seat 
of hall master out from beneath them, but they were willing to 
begrudgingly accept it because it was Paul. However, if he was going 
to treat as worthless something that they considered precious, 
something they’d fought so hard to try to obtain, then that changed 
things.
They decided to try getting rid of Paul. During practice matches, 
they would focus their attacks on him, come at him from behind with 
flying kicks, and purposefully spill water on his training outfit. Lilia 
took Paul’s side and reprimanded them. The students didn’t look too 
kindly upon that, either, and their behavior escalated.
If Paul were a normal boy, it would have ended there. He would 
have acquiesced and made way for the others, or he would’ve fled 
from the hall after being chased out. However, Paul was a bad boy. 
With his mood soured, he resorted to acting out.
One night, he snuck into Lilia’s sleeping chambers and stole her 
innocence. Lilia tried to struggle of course, but there was nothing she 
could do. Once everything was over, she was left in a daze. She 
couldn’t process what it was that had happened to her. She never 
dreamed that Paul, whom she’d spoken so cheerfully with a few days 
prior, would do something like that. By the time her mother came 
into the room to see why her daughter hadn’t gotten up yet and 
screamed at what she saw, Paul had already left town.
250    
Lilia developed a distrust for men after that. She felt fear at the 
gazes of the other students and blatantly avoided bodily contact. 
That didn’t change, not even after she turned fifteen and became an 
adult. Lilia’s father was honor-bound to see to the survival of the 
sword hall, which had been in the family for generations. He had no 
son, and Lilia’s birth had ruined her mother’s body. He would have to 
marry her to one of his students to see his legacy continue. Still, a 
father was a father. As a parent, he couldn’t force his daughter to be 
with a man after the deep mental scars she’d sustained.
Instead, he used his personal connections to recommend her to 
the Asura Royal Family as a maid and lady-in-waiting whose duties 
extended to taking up arms to protect the royal family when 
necessary. Lilia gradually overcame her distrust of men during her 
time serving as a guardswoman, but then sustained an injury while 
protecting the princess. Discharged from service, she headed for the 
Fittoa Region instead of returning home, where, by some twist of 
fate, she found a job as a maid to Paul’s new family. She and Paul 
rekindled their affair, she got pregnant with his child, and then she 
became his second wife.
In all honesty, Lilia didn’t know at the time if she was happy or 
not. She was basically a mistress, and Paul probably loved Zenith 
more than he did her. Zenith was a dear friend to her, but Lilia had 
complex feelings of guilt and remorse. The Greyrats had accepted 
her as part of the family, but her anxiety and insecurity persisted. 
Rudeus, who supported her in this time of mental turmoil, had 
been the one who talked Zenith into letting Lilia stay. Raising her 
daughter to someday serve him was the one thing Lilia could be 
certain she wanted, though she found herself questioning what this 
said about how much she loved Aisha. Her own father had cared 
more for her happiness than the continuation of his sword hall, 
which was why he’d helped her find another path in life. Was Lilia 
not trampling over the feelings of Aisha—her own daughter—if she 
251    
used her to repay her debt to Rudeus and buy herself some peace of 
mind? Those worries only worsened as she realized that her 
daughter was not an ordinary child, but exceptionally intelligent. 
The turning point came with the mysterious Displacement 
Incident, in which Lilia and Aisha were teleported to the Shirone 
Kingdom together. One moment they’d lost consciousness, and the 
next, they were in an expensive-looking room. Soon enough, they 
were completely surrounded by guards.
Faced with hostile, murderous men in armor, Lilia’s mind went 
blank. Unable to comprehend what was happening, the one thought 
that came to her mind was I have to protect my daughter. Lilia 
grabbed the nearest candle stand, pushed her daughter behind her, 
and fought. However, after her long absence from actual battle, her 
body didn’t move as she willed it, and the old wound in her leg only 
further hampered her mobility. Unable to offer much resistance, 
they were captured and Aisha was dragged along by the soldiers 
behind her mother.
“Please! Just spare the girl! Please just help my daughter! I don’t 
care what happens to me! Just my daughter!” Lilia wept and 
screamed pitifully, but those words came unbidden and 
unconsciously. They were her true feelings.
Her true feelings.
After that, Lilia was confined to the castle, kept from making any 
contact with the outside world, and forced to work as a maid. 
However, her heart was lighter than before. The words that had 
spilled from her in a moment of desperation were pleas to save 
Aisha. She no longer doubted her love for her daughter, and was 
satisfied that her desire to have her serve Rudeus was not a purely 
selfish one.

Aisha was free-spirited and independent, perhaps because she 
took after Paul. She hated being restrained and found her mother 
suffocating. She couldn’t comprehend why she should serve Rudeus, 
and being so clever, Aisha detested working hard toward a goal that 
she couldn’t understand the meaning of.
Still, Lilia didn’t give up. She taught her recalcitrant daughter all 
the knowledge she’d collected over the years. One day, Aisha would 
understand. As long as Rudeus remained the same person he had 
been on that day when he protected Lilia, Aisha would understand. 
Or so she thought…
   
“Ahh, Big Brother Kennel Master… Aah, he’s all I can think 
about. Those sturdy arms that lifted me up, his gallant face, and 
confused attitude…”
Aisha did understand. She’d seen Rudeus for herself and 
understood the meaning behind what Lilia had been doing—but this 
was also wrong. This wasn’t the way she’d envisioned her daughter 
coming to understand Rudeus’s greatness.
“Aisha.” Lilia gradually stood up in the middle of the swaying 
carriage.
Aisha, who’d had a mischievous smile on her face, trembled 
with surprise at her mother’s movement. Lilia had a habit of 
smacking Aisha on the head when she said or did something bad. 
Granted, Aisha was clever. She could estimate, to a certain degree, 
what would get her hit and what wouldn’t, and she was mischievous 
enough to bait Lilia into hitting her, then stick her tongue out and 
resolve it with a “Sowwy.”   
But this time she didn’t know why her mother was angry. She 
was complimenting Rudeus—complimenting the older brother her 
mother told her to serve. Had she messed up somehow? Or was the 
Kennel Master not her brother after all? Those worries flashed 
through her mind as her mother’s hand approached her.
“Huh…?”
Aisha froze as she felt something soft brush the top of her head. 
Lilia was patting her. Times like these, when her mother stroked her 
hair, were far and few between. 
“Mother?”
For some reason, Lilia felt timid when her daughter addressed 
her. Her hand, which had been stroking Aisha’s head, now moved to 
the little girl’s back, drawing her small body close. “Aisha. Mister 
Kennel Master or Master Rudeus… whoever you choose is fine with 
me.”
Rudeus had refused to take Aisha with him, but Lilia was certain 
that, a few years from now, the day would come when they were 
reunited again.
“And when that day comes, give everything you have to serve 
him.” As Lilia said those words, she swore to herself that she would 
raise Aisha to be a wonderful woman, and that it wouldn’t be for 
Rudeus’ sake. Or for her own. Lilia was aware that her own 
egotistical feelings were still mixed into that sentiment, but she truly, 
from the bottom of her heart, wanted Aisha to grow into a 
remarkable woman.
“Ahaha… I guess you caught me after all…huh?” Aisha felt 
uneasy about the soft sensation on her head, and her lips curled 
upward. “I-I knew, of course! That the Kennel Master is my brother… 
so I just kind of wanted to try teasing you, just a little…”
As she stammered her incoherent excuse, it suddenly occurred 
to Aisha that she might never have been embraced like this by her  
mother before. As soon as she thought that, an incredible wave of 
happiness swept over her. It was the first time the young girl had 
ever experienced crying with joy. Confused by the tears that refused 
to stop, she just wrapped her arms around her mother and soaked 
her shoulder.
Ginger, who had been watching the two, averted her eyes. Her 
gaze turned to the water paddies as they rippled in the wind, 
extending for as far as the eye could see.
